[BleBox](https://blebox.eu/?lang=en) produces small, low-power, surprisingly affordable, feature-rich WiFi devices for serverless home automation.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

For the best experience, make sure your BleBox devices have the most recent available firmware installed.

Additionally, if you are configuring a gateBox, it may be useful to set the second button as "stop" in your device's settings (via website or phone app).
