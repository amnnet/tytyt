Text-to-Speech (TTS) enables Home Assistant to speak to you.

## Configuring a `tts` platform

To get started, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` (example for Google):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for Google TTS service
tts:
  - platform: google_translate
```

<div class='note'>

Depending on your setup, you might need to set an external URL (`external_url`) inside the [configuration](/docs/configuration/basic/) or in the parameters of this component.

</div>

The following optional parameters can be used with any platform. However, the TTS integration will only look for global settings under the configuration of the first configured platform:

{% configuration %}
cache:
  description: Allow TTS to cache voice file to local storage.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: true
cache_dir:
  description: Folder name or path to a folder for caching files.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: tts
time_memory:
  description: Time to hold the voice data inside memory for fast play on a media player. Minimum is 60 s and the maximum 57600 s (16 hours).
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 300
base_url:
  description: A base URL to use *instead* of the one set in the Home Assistant [configuration](/docs/configuration/basic). It is used as-is by the `tts` component. In particular, you need to include the protocol scheme `http://` or `https://` and the correct port number. They will not be automatically added for you.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: value of internal URL
service_name:
  description: Define the service name.
  required: false
  type: string
  default:  The service name default set to <platform>_say. For example, for google_translate tts, its service name default is `google_translate_say`.
{% endconfiguration %}

The extended example from above would look like the following sample:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for Google Translate TTS service
tts:
  - platform: google_translate
    cache: true
    cache_dir: /tmp/tts
    time_memory: 300
    base_url: http://192.168.0.10:8123
    service_name: google_say
```

<div class='note'>

In the above example, `base_url` is custom to this particular TTS platform configuration. It is not suggesting that you use the internal URL that you have set for your core Home Assistant configuration. The reason you might need to do this is outlined in the next section.

</div>

## When do you need to set `base_url` here?

The general answer is "whenever the global internal URL set in the [configuration](/docs/configuration/basic/) of Home Assistant is not adequate to allow the `say` service to run". The `say` service operates by generating a media file that contains the speech corresponding to the text passed to the service. Then the `say` service sends a message to the media device with a URL pointing to the file. The device fetches the media file at the URL and plays the media. Some combinations of a media device, network configuration and Home Assistant configuration can make it so that the device cannot fetch the media file.

The following sections describe some of the problems encountered with media devices.

### Self-signed certificates

This problem occurs when your Home Assistant instance is configured to be accessed through SSL, and you are using a self-signed certificate on your internal URL.

The `tts` service will send an `https://` URL to the media device, which will check the certificate, and reject it. So it won't play your file. If you could make the device accept your certificate, it would play the file. However, many media devices do not allow changing settings to accept self-signed certificates. Ultimately, your option may be to serve files to local devices as `http://` rather than `https://`.

### Google cast devices

The Google cast devices (Google Home, Chromecast, etc.) present the following problems:

* They [reject self-signed certificates](#self-signed-certificates).

* They do not work with URLs that contain hostnames established by local naming means. Let's say your Home Assistant instance is running on a machine made known locally as `ha`. All your machines on your local network are able to access it as `ha`. However, try as you may, your cast device won't download the media files from your `ha` machine. That's because your cast device ignores your local naming setup. In this example, the `say` service creates a URL like `http://ha/path/to/media.mp3` (or `https://...` if you are using SSL). If you are _not_ using SSL then setting an internal URL that contains the IP address of your server works around this issue. By using an IP address, the cast device does not have to resolve the hostname.

* If you are using an SSL (e.g., `https://yourhost.example.org/...`) then you _must_ use the hostname in the certificate (e.g., `base_url: https://yourhost.example.org`). You cannot use an IP address since the certificate won't be valid for the IP address, and the cast device will refuse the connection.

## Service say

The `say` service support `language` and on some platforms also `options` for set, i.e., *voice, motion, speed, etc*. The text for speech is set with `message`. Since release 0.92, service name can be defined in configuration `service_name` option.

Say to all `media_player` device entities:

```yaml
# Replace google_translate_say with <platform>_say when you use a different platform.
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  entity_id: all
  message: "May the force be with you."
```

Say to the `media_player.floor` device entity:

```yaml
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  entity_id: media_player.floor
  message: "May the force be with you."
```

Say to the `media_player.floor` device entity in French:

```yaml
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  entity_id: media_player.floor
  message: "Que la force soit avec toi."
  language: "fr"
```

With a template:

{% raw %}

```yaml
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  message: "Temperature is {{states('sensor.temperature')}}."
  cache: false
```

{% endraw %}

## Cache

The integration has two caches. Both caches can be controlled with the `cache` option in the platform configuration or the service call `say`. A long time cache will be located on the file system. The in-memory cache for fast responses to media players will be auto-cleaned after a short period.

## REST API

### POST `/api/tts_get_url`

Returns a URL to the generated TTS file. Platform and message are required.

```json
{
    "platform": "amazon_polly",
    "message": "I am speaking now"
}
```

The return code is 200 if the file is generated. The message body will contain a JSON object with the URL.

```json
{
    "path": "/api/tts_proxy/265944c108cbb00b2a621be5930513e03a0bb2cd_en_-_demo.mp3",
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8123/api/tts_proxy/265944c108cbb00b2a621be5930513e03a0bb2cd_en_-_demo.mp3"
}
```

Sample `curl` command:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS TOKEN>" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"message": "I am speaking now", "platform": "amazon_polly"}' \
       http://localhost:8123/api/tts_get_url
```
