[Modbus](http://www.modbus.org/) is a serial communication protocol to control PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller) and RTUs (Remote Terminal Unit). The integration adheres strictly to the [protocol specification](https://modbus.org/docs/Modbus_Application_Protocol_V1_1b3.pdf).
Modbus supports all devices adhering to the Modbus standard. The communication between the device(s) can be serial (rs-485), TCP, or UDP connections. The Modbus integration allows multiple communications e.g. serial combined with TCP or different TCP connected devices.

# Configuring Modbus

First, you define how to communicate with your Modbus devices and after that you define the information being exchanged. The Modbus integration allows you to use multiple connections.

## Configuring Modbus common parameters

Part of the configuration is common for all types of communication. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: "hub1"
    close_comm_on_error: true
    delay: 5
    timeout: 5
    type: tcp
```

{% configuration %}
close_comm_on_error:
  description: Determines if the device connection is closed when an error occurs, default is true. Some serial-rs485 adapters deliver garble when opened, this leads to a disconnect and a new connect, which can continue. If in a running communication the debug log contains a message from pymodbus, with the text "cleaning....", then try this parameter.
  required: false
  default: true
  type: boolean
delay:
  description: "Time to delay sending messages in seconds after connecting. Some Modbus devices need a delay of typically 1-2 seconds after established connection to prepare the communication. If a device does not respond to messages after connecting, this parameter might help. Remark: the delay is solely between connect and the first message."
  required: false
  default: 0
  type: integer
message_wait_milliseconds:
  description: Time to wait in milliseconds between requests.
  required: false
  default: 30 for serial connection, 0 for everything else.
  type: integer
name:
  description: Name for this hub. Must be unique, so it is required when setting up multiple instances.
  required: false
  default: "modbus_hub"
  type: string
retries:
  description: Number of times to retry a request.
  required: false
  default: 3
  type: integer
retry_on_empty:
  description: Retry request, when receiving and empty message.
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
timeout:
  description: "Timeout while waiting for a response in seconds."
  required: false
  default: 5
  type: integer
type:
  description: Type of communication. Possible values are `tcp` Modbus messages with Modbus TCP frame on TCP/IP, `udp` Modbus messages with Modbus TCP frame on UDP, `rtuovertcp` Modbus messages with a wrapper TCP/IP simulating a serial line.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Configuring network connection

For a network (type: `tcp`/`udp`/`rtuovertcp`) connection, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file, in addition to the [common parameters](#configuring-modbus-common-parameters):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for a TCP connection
modbus:
  - name: "hub1"
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP address of your Modbus device, e.g., `192.168.1.1`.
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: The network port for the communication.
  required: true
  type: integer
type:
  description: "Type of the connection to Modbus, needs to be `tcp` or `udp` or `rtuovertcp` for this setup."
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Configuring serial connection

For a serial connection, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file, in addition to the [common parameters](#configuring-modbus-common-parameters):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for a serial connection
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: serial
    baudrate: 9600
    bytesize: 8
    method: rtu
    parity: E
    port: /dev/ttyUSB0
    stopbits: 1
```

{% configuration %}
baudrate:
  description: The speed for the serial connection.
  required: true
  type: integer
bytesize:
  description: "The bytesize for the serial connection; can be `5`, `6`, `7` or `8`."
  required: true
  type: integer
method:
  description: "Method of the connection to Modbus, either `rtu` or `ascii`."
  required: true
  type: string
parity:
  description: "The parity for the serial connection; can be `E`, `O` or `N`."
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: The port where your Modbus device is connected to your Home Assistant host.
  required: true
  type: string
stopbits:
  description: "The stopbits for the serial connection, either `1` or `2`."
  required: true
  type: integer
type:
  description: "Type of the connection to Modbus, needs to be `serial` for this setup."
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Configuring multiple connections

Multiple connections are possible with identical/different `type:`.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for multiple TCP connections
modbus:
  - type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS_1
    port: 2020
    name: "hub1"

  - type: udp
    host: IP_ADDRESS_2
    port: 501
    name: hub2
```

Remark: `name:`is required for multiple connections, because it needs to be unique.

## Modbus services

The Modbus integration provides two generic write services in addition to the platform-specific services.

| Service | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| modbus.write_register | Write register or registers |
| modbus.write_coil | Write coil or coils |

Description:

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| hub       | Hub name (defaults to 'modbus_hub' when omitted) |
| unit      | Slave address (0-255) |
| address   | Address of the Register (e.g. 138) |
| value     | (write_register) A single value or an array of 16-bit values. Single value will call modbus function code 0x06. Array will call modbus function code 0x10. Values might need reverse ordering. E.g., to set 0x0004 you might need to set `[4,0]`, this depend on the byte order of your CPU |
| state     | (write_coil) A single boolean or an array of booleans. Single boolean will call modbus function code 0x05. Array will call modbus function code 0x0F |

The Modbus integration also provides communication stop/restart services. These services will not do any reconfiguring, but simply stop/start the modbus communication layer.

| Service | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| modbus.stop | Stop communication |
| modbus.restart | Restart communication (Stop first if running) |

Description:

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| hub       | Hub name (defaults to 'modbus_hub' when omitted) |

### Example: writing a float32 type register

To write a float32 datatype register use network format like `10.0` == `0x41200000` (network order float hexadecimal). 

```yaml
service: modbus.write_register
data:
  address: <target register address>
  unit: <target slave address>
  hub: <hub name>
  value: [0x4120, 0x0000]

## Configuring platform cover

The `modbus` cover platform allows you to control covers (such as blinds, a roller shutter, or a garage door).

At the moment, platform cover support the opening and closing of a cover. You can control your covers either using coils or holding registers.

Cover that uses `input_type: coil` is not able to determine intermediary states such as opening and closing. Coil stores only two states — "0" means cover closed, and "1" implies cover open. To allow detecting intermediary states, there is an optional `status_register` attribute. It will enable you to write your command (e.g., to open a cover) into a coil, and read current cover status back through the register. Additionally, you can specify values for `state_open`, `state_opening`, `state_closed`, and `state_closing` attributes. These will be matched with the value read from the `status_register`.

If your cover uses ìnput_type: holding` (default) to send commands, it can also read the intermediary states. To adjust which value represents what state, you can fine-tune the optional state attributes, like `state_open`. These optional state values are also used for specifying values written into the register. If you specify an optional status_register attribute, cover states will be read from status_register instead of the register used for sending commands.

To use Modbus covers in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file, in addition to the [common parameters](#configuring-platform-common-parameters):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    covers:
      - name: Door1
        device_class: door
        input_type: coil
        address: 117
        device_class: door
        state_open: 1
        state_opening: 2
        state_closed: 0

      required: false
      default: 1
      type: integer
    state_closed:
      description: A value in `status_register` or `register` representing a closed cover. If your configuration uses the `register` attribute, this value will be written into the holding register to close the cover.
      required: false
      default: 0
      type: integer
    state_opening:
      description: A value in `status_register` or `register` representing an opening cover. Note that this state should be also supported on your connected Modbus cover. If it won't report the state, this state won't be detected.
      required: false
      default: 2
      type: integer
    state_closing:
      description: A value in `status_register` or `register` representing a closing cover. Note that this state should be also supported on your connected Modbus cover. If it won't reeport the state, this state won't be detected.
      required: false
      default: 3
      type: integer
    status_register:
      description: An address of a register, from which all the cover states will be read. If you specified `register` attribute, and not `status_register` attribute, your main register will also be used as a status register.

### Example: Modbus cover controlled by a coil

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a coil. Intermediary states like opening/closing are not supported. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        coil: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
      - name: Door2
        slave: 2
        coil: 2
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
```

### Example: Modbus cover controlled by a coil, its state is read from the register

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a coil. Actual cover state is read from the `status_register`. We've also specified register values to match with the states open/opening/closed/closing. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
        coil: 1
        status_register: 1
        status_register_type: input
        state_opening: 1
        state_open: 2
        state_closing: 3
        state_closed: 4
```

### Example: Modbus cover controlled by a holding register

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a holding register, from which we also read current cover state. We've also specified register values to match with the states open/opening/closed/closing. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
        register: 1
        state_opening: 1
        state_open: 2
        state_closing: 3
        state_closed: 4
```

### Example: Modbus cover controlled by a holding register, its state is read from the status register

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a holding register. However, cover state is read from a `status_register`. In this case, we've specified only values for `state_open` and `state_closed`, for the rest, default values are used. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502

    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
        register: 1
        status_register: 2
        register_type: holding
        state_open: 1
        state_closed: 0
```

## Configuring platform light

The `modbus` light platform allows you to control [Modbus](http://www.modbus.org/) coils or registers.

To use your Modbus lights in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file, in addition to the [common parameters](#configuring-platform-common-parameters):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
modbus:
  - type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    lights:
      - name: "light1"
        address: 13
        write_type: coil
      - name: "light2"
        slave: 2
        address: 14
        write_type: coil
        verify:
      - name: "Register1"
        address: 11
        command_on: 1
        command_off: 0
        verify:
            input_type: holding
            address: 127
            state_on: 25
            state_off: 1
```

## Configuring platform sensor

The `modbus` sensor allows you to gather data from [Modbus](http://www.modbus.org/) registers.

To use your Modbus sensors in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file, in addition to the [common parameters](#configuring-platform-common-parameters) and [response regresentation](#configuring-data_type-and-struct):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    sensors:
      - name: Sensor1
        unit_of_measurement: °C
        slave: 1
        address: 100
      - name: Sensor2
        unit_of_measurement: mg
        address: 110
        count: 2
      - name: Sensor3
        unit_of_measurement: °C
        slave: 1
        address: 120
        input_type: input
        data_type: float
        scale: 0.01
        offset: -273.16
        precision: 2
```

{% configuration %}
sensors:
  description: The array contains a list of all your Modbus sensors.
  required: true
  type: map
  keys:
    address:
      description: Register number.
      required: true
      type: integer
    count:
      description: Number of registers to read.
      required: false
      type: integer
      default: 1 or calculated if data_type is not `struct`.
    device_class:
      description: The [type/class](/integrations/sensor/#device-class) of the sensor to set the icon in the frontend.
      required: false
      type: device_class
      default: None
    input_type:
      description: Modbus register type (holding, input), default holding.
      required: false
      type: string
    name:
      description: Name of the sensor.
      required: true
      type: string
    scan_interval:
      description: Defines the update interval of the sensor in seconds.
      required: false
      type: integer
      default: 15
    slave:
      description: The number of the slave (Optional for tcp and upd Modbus).
      required: true
      type: integer
    unit_of_measurement:
      description: Unit to attach to value.

      type: integer
    state_class:
      description: The [state_class](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor#available-state-classes) of the sensor.
      required: false
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note'>

If you specify scale or offset as floating point values, double precision floating point arithmetic will be used to calculate final value. This can cause loss of precision for values that are larger than 2^53.

        offset: 0
        precision: 1
        data_type: integer
```

## Configuring platform switch

The `modbus` switch platform allows you to control [Modbus](http://www.modbus.org/) coils or registers.

To use your Modbus switches in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file, in addition to the [common parameters](#configuring-platform-common-parameters):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
modbus:
  - type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    switches:
      - name: Switch1
        address: 13
        write_type: coil
      - name: Switch2
        slave: 2
        address: 14
        write_type: coil
        verify:
      - name: Register1
        address: 11
        command_on: 1
        command_off: 0
        verify:
            input_type: holding
            address: 127
            state_on: 25
            state_off: 1
