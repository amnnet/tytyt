The `dwd_weather_warnings` sensor platform uses the [Deutsche Wetter Dienst (DWD)](https://www.dwd.de) as a source for current and advance warnings.

- A name is optional but if multiple regions are used a name will be required.
- The sensor checks for new data every 15 minutes.

## Configuration

To add the DWD WarnApp sensor to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: dwd_weather_warnings
    region_name: Hansestadt Hamburg
```

<div class="note">

- The `region_name` can either be a so called `warncell id` (integer) or a `warncell name` (string). It is heavily advised to use `warncell id` because `warncell name` is not unique in some cases.  
A list of valid warncell ids and names can be found at [here](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/opendata/help/warnungen/cap_warncellids_csv.html).
- Some of the warncells are outdated but still listed. If setup fails search the list for a similar sounding warncell.
- If you selected a `warncell name` and the name is not unique `" (not unique used ID)!"` will be added to the reported `region_name`.
