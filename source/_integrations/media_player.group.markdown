The group media player platform lets you combine multiple media players into one entity. All child media players of a media player group can still be used as usual, but controlling the state of the grouped media player will forward the command to each child media player.

To enable this platform in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: group
    entities:
      - media_player.kitchen_tv
      - media_player.livivng_room_tv
```

{% configuration %}
entities:
  description: A list of entities to be included in the media player group.
  required: true
  type: [string, list]
name:
  description: The name of the media player group. Defaults to "Media Group".
  required: false
  type: string
unique_id:
  description: An ID that uniquely identifies this media player group. If two media players have the same unique ID, Home Assistant will raise an error.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Script Example

Here's an example of a script using the above media player group.

```yaml
script:
  tts:
    alias: Run TTS
    sequence:
      service: tts.google_translate_say
      entity_id: media_player.media_group
      data:
        message: 'The cake is a lie.'
```
