The `group` platform can create a cover that combines several cover entities into one.

To enable `Cover Groups` in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: group
    entities:
      - cover.hall_window
      - cover.living_room_window
```

{% configuration %}
entities:
  description: List of all cover entities you want to control.
  required: true
  type: [string, list]
name:
  description: Name to use in the frontend.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "Cover Group"
unique_id:
  description: An ID that uniquely identifies this cover group. If two covers have the same unique ID, Home Assistant will raise an error.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Functionality

It works best if you group covers with the same supported features together (like support for `open`/`close`/`stop`/`position`/`tilt controls`), but is not limited to it. In case you have bundled covers with different features together, the controls will only affect those covers that support the actions.
