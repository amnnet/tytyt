The notify TTS platform lets you use the TTS integration [Service Say](/integrations/tts/#service-say) and a [media_player](/integrations/media_player) to alert you of important events. This integration provides a simple interface to use in your automations and alerts.

In order to use this integration, you must already have a TTS platform installed and configured, and a media_player working with the TTS platform.

To enable this platform in your installation, consider the following example using [google_translate](/integrations/google_translate/) and an example `media_player.living_room`. 

In your `configuration.yaml` file type:

```yaml
tts:
  - platform: google_translate
    service_name: google_say

notify:
  - platform: tts
    name: in_the_living_room
    tts_service: tts.google_say
    media_player: media_player.living_room
```

Please note that the `tts_service` parameter, must match the `service_name` defined in the TTS integration.
