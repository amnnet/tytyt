The `shopping_list` integration allows you to keep track of shopping list items. 

Your shopping list will be accessible from the sidebar, and you can optionally add the [Shopping List card](/lovelace/shopping-list/) to your Lovelace dashboard. With the [Conversation integration](/integrations/conversation/) you can add items to your shopping list using voice commands like "Add eggs to my shopping list." 

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Using in Automations

The simplest way use shopping list with automations (e.g., when entering a zone with shops) is to create a notification that can be clicked to open the shopping list.
This is tested to work with the Android companion app.

{% raw %}

```yaml
service: notify.notify
title: "Time to shop?"
message: 'Click to open the shopping list'
data:
  clickAction: "/shopping-list"
  url: "/shopping-list"
```

{% endraw %}
