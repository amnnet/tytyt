The `co2signal` sensor platform queries the [CO2Signal](https://www.co2signal.com/) API for the CO2 intensity of a specific region. Data can be collected for your home, a specific latitude/longitude or by country code. This API uses the same data as <https://www.electricitymap.org>. Not all countries/regions in the world are supported so please consult this website to check local availability.

## Prerequisites

To configure and use this integration, you need to obtain a [free API key from CO2Signal](https://www.co2signal.com/).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Sensor Types

When configured, the platform will create two sensors for each configured location: the carbon intensity expressed in `gCO2eq/kWh` and a percentage how much the grid relies on fossil fuels for production.
