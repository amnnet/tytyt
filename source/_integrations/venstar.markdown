The `venstar` climate platform allows you to control [Venstar](https://www.venstar.com/) thermostats from Home Assistant.
Venstar thermostats feature a local API that allows for automation without the need for their Skyport cloud service.

Currently supported and tested thermostats:

- ColorTouch T7900  
- ColorTouch T7850  (No Humidity control)
- Explorer Mini T2000

Currently supported functionality:
- Setting heat/cool temperature when the thermostat is in the appropriate mode.
- Changing the operation mode of the thermostat (heat/cool/off/auto)
- Turning the fan on/off
- Reading and setting the humidity level and limits (T7900 only)
- Turning on away preset
- Turning on hold mode preset

The following values are supported for the preset_mode state attribute:
- `none`: *Enables* the scheduling functionality.
- `temperature`: *Disables* the schedule and holds the set temperature indefinitely.
- `away`: Places the thermostat in away mode

Note - Please ensure that you update your thermostat to the latest firmware. Initially tested on firmware 5.10 and currently VH6.79.  

Local API mode needs to be enabled via the thermostat's *Menu > WiFi > Local API Options > Local API - ON*
