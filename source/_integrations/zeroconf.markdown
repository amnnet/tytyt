The `zeroconf` integration will scan the network for supported devices and services. Discovered integrations will show up in the discovered section on the integrations page in the configuration panel. It will also make Home Assistant discoverable for other services in the network. Zeroconf is also sometimes known as Bonjour, Rendezvous, and Avahi.

Integrations can opt-in to be found by adding either [a Zeroconf section](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/next/creating_integration_manifest.html#zeroconf) or [a HomeKit section](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/next/creating_integration_manifest.html#homekit) to their `manifest.json`.

## Configuration

This integration is by default enabled, unless you've disabled or removed the [`default_config:`](/integrations/default_config/) line from your configuration. If that is the case, and you wish to have Home Assistant scan for integrations using zeroconf and HomeKit, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
zeroconf:
```

## Network interfaces and auto detection

Zeroconf chooses which interfaces to broadcast on based on the [Network](/integrations/network/) integration.

IPv6 will automatically be enabled if one of the selected interfaces has an IPv6 address that is enabled via the Network integration.
