The `waze_travel_time` sensor provides travel time from the [Waze](https://www.waze.com/).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

Notes:

- If a unit system is not specified, the integration will use the unit system configured on your Home Assistant instance.
- Origin and Destination can be the address or the GPS coordinates of the location (GPS coordinates has to be separated by a comma). You can also enter an entity id which provides this information in its state, an entity id with latitude and longitude attributes, or zone friendly name.
- The string inputs for `Substring *` allow you to force the integration to use a particular route or avoid a particular route in its time travel calculation. These inputs are case insensitive matched against the description of the route.
- When using the `Avoid Toll Roads?`, `Avoid Subscription Roads?` and `Avoid Ferries?` options be aware that Waze will sometimes still route you over toll roads or ferries if a valid vignette/subscription is assumed. Default behavior is that Waze will route you over roads having subscription options, so best is to set both `Avoid Toll Roads?` and `Avoid Subscription Roads?` or `Avoid Ferries?` if needed and experiment to ensure the desired outcome.

## Manual Polling

Some users will want to have more control over polling frequencies. To use more granular polling, disable automated polling in your config entry's System Options. To manually trigger a polling request, call the [`homeassistant.update_entity` service](/integrations/homeassistant/#service-homeassistantupdate_entity) as needed, either manually or via automations.

## Example using dynamic destination

Using the flexible option to set a sensor value to the `Destination`, you can setup a single Waze integration that will calculate travel time to multiple optional locations on demand.

In the following example, the `Input Select` is converted into an address which is used to modify the destination for Waze route calculation from `device_tracker.myphone` location (It takes a few minutes for the value to update due to the interval of Waze data fetching).

{% raw %}

```yaml
input_select:
  destination:
    name: destination
    options:
      - Home
      - Work
      - Parents

template:
  - sensor:
     - name: "Destination address"
       state: >-
          {%- if is_state("input_select.destination", "Home")  -%}
            725 5th Ave, New York, NY 10022, USA
          {%- elif is_state("input_select.destination", "Work")  -%}
            767 5th Ave, New York, NY 10153, USA
          {%- elif is_state("input_select.destination", "Parents")  -%}
            178 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211, USA
          {%- else -%}
            Unknown
          {%- endif %}

```

{% endraw %}

### Various configurations that are supported

#### Tracking entity to entity

In this example we use a device_tracker entity ID as the origin and the sensor created above as the destination.

Name: "Me to destination"
Origin: device_tracker.myphone
Destination: sensor.dest_address
Region: "US"

#### Tracking entity to zone friendly name

In this example we are using the entity ID of a zone as the origin and the friendly name of a zone as the destination.

Name: "Home To Eddie's House"
Origin: zone.home
Destination: "Eddies House"
Region: "US"

#### Tracking entity in Imperial Units

Origin: person.paulus
Destination: "725 5th Ave, New York, NY 10022, USA"
Region: "US"
Units: imperial
Vehicle Type: motorcycle

#### Avoiding toll, subscription

Name: "Westerscheldetunnel"
Origin: 51.330436, 3.802043
Destination: 51.445677, 3.749929
Region: "EU"
Avoid Toll Roads?: True
Avoid Subscription Roads?: True
