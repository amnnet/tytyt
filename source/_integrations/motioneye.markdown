The motionEye integration allows you to integrate your
[motionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye) server into Home Assistant. motionEye
is an open source web-frontend for the motion daemon, used to centralize the management
and visualization of multiple types of cameras.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

Note that the URL required is the URL for the motionEye server itself -- **not** the URL for the camera stream(s) that it makes available.

## MotionEye Cameras

As cameras are added or removed to motionEye, they are automatically added or removed
from Home Assistant.
