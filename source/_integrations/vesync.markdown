The `vesync` integration enables you to control smart switches and outlets connected to the VeSync App.

The devices must be added to the VeSync App before this integration can discover them.

The following platforms are supported:

- **light**
- **switch**
- **fan**

## Supported Devices

This integration supports devices controllable by the VeSync App.  The following devices are supported by this integration:

### Bulbs
- Etekcity WiFi Dimmable LED Bulb (ESL100)
- Etekcity WiFi Dimmable and Tunable White LED Bulb (ESL100CW)

### Wall Switches

## Prerequisite

Before you can use this integration, all devices must be registered with the
VeSync App. Once registration is complete, continue with the steps described in
the configuration section below.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Services

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `update_devices` | Poll Vesync server to find and add any new devices |

## Outlet Exposed Attributes

VeSync outlets will expose the following details for only the smart outlets. Energy monitoring not available for in-wall switches.

| `weekly_energy_total`   | Total energy usage for week starting from Monday 12:01AM in kWh         | 14.74           |
| `monthly_energy_total`  | Total energy usage for month starting from 12:01AM on the first in kWh  | 52.30           |
| `yearly_energy_total`   | Total energy usage for year start from 12:01AM on Jan 1 in kWh          | 105.25          |

## Fan Exposed Attributes

VeSync air purifiers will expose the following details depending on the features supported by the model:

| Attribute               | Description                                                                       | Example         |

## Extracting Attribute data

In order to get the attributes readings from supported devices, such as energy from outlets or fan attributes, you'll have to create a [template sensor](/integrations/switch.template/).

In the example below, change all of the `vesync_switch`'s to match your device's entity ID.

Adapted from the [TP-Link integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tplink/#plugs).

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
    - name: "Vesync current comsumption"
      state: "{{ state_attr('switch.vesync_switch', 'current_power_w') | float(default=0) }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "W"
    - name: "Vesync total consumption"
      state: "{{ state_attr('switch.vesync_switch', 'today_energy_kwh') | float(default=0) }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
    - name: "Vesync voltage"
      state: "{{ state_attr('switch.vesync_switch', 'voltage') | float(default=0) }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "V"
```
{% endraw %}

Extracting air quality from a VeSync LV-PUR131S air purifier. Change the `vesync_air_purifier` to match your device's entity ID.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "VeSync Air Quality"
        state: "{{ state_attr('fan.vesync_air_purifier', 'air_quality') | title }}"
```

{% endraw %}
