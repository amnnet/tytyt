The `template` integration allows creating entities which derive their values from other data. This is done by specifying [templates](/docs/configuration/templating/) for properties of an entity, like the name or the state.

Sensors, binary (on/off) sensors, numbers and selects are covered on this page. For other types, please see the specific pages:

- [Alarm Control Panel](/integrations/alarm_control_panel.template/)
- [Cover](/integrations/cover.template/)
- [Fan](/integrations/fan.template/)
- [Light](/integrations/light.template/)
- [Lock](/integrations/lock.template/)
- [Switch](/integrations/switch.template/)
- [Vacuum](/integrations/vacuum.template/)
- [Weather](/integrations/weather.template/)

Sensor, binary sensor, number and select template entities are defined in your YAML configuration files, directly under the `template:` key and cannot be configured via the UI. You can define multiple configuration blocks as a list. Each block defines sensor/binary sensor/number/select entities and can contain an optional update trigger.

_For old sensor/binary sensor configuration format, [see below](#legacy-binary-sensor-configuration-format)._

## State-based template sensors

Template entities will by default update as soon as any of the referenced data in the template updates.

For example, you can have a template that takes the averages of two sensors. Home Assistant will update your template sensor as soon as either source sensor updates.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Average temperature"
        unit_of_measurement: "°C"
        state: >
          {% set bedroom = states('sensor.bedroom_temperature') | float %}
          {% set kitchen = states('sensor.kitchen_temperature') | float %}

          {{ ((bedroom + kitchen) / 2) | round(1, default=0) }}
```

{% endraw %}

## Trigger-based template sensors

If you want more control over when an entity updates, you can define a trigger. Triggers follow the same format and work exactly the same as [triggers in automations][trigger-doc]. This feature is a great way to create entities based on webhook data ([example](#storing-webhook-information)), or update entities based on a schedule.

Whenever the trigger fires, all related entities will re-render and it will have access to [the trigger data](/docs/automation/templating/) in the templates.

Trigger-based entities do not automatically update when states referenced in the templates change. This functionality can be added back by defining a [state trigger](/docs/automation/trigger/#state-trigger) for each entity that you want to trigger updates.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration entry
template:
  - trigger:
      - platform: time_pattern
        # This will update every night
        hours: 0
        minutes: 0
    sensor:
      # Keep track how many days have past since a date
      - name: "Not smoking"
        state: '{{ ( ( as_timestamp(now()) - as_timestamp(strptime("06.07.2018", "%d.%m.%Y")) ) / 86400 ) | round(default=0) }}'
        unit_of_measurement: "Days"
```

{% endraw %}

{% endconfiguration %}

The above configuration variables describe a configuration section. The template integration allows defining multiple sections.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry with two sections
template:
  # Define state-based template entities
  - sensor:
      ...
    binary_sensor:
      ...

  # Define trigger-based template entities
  - trigger:
      ...
    sensor:
      ...
    binary_sensor:
      ...
```

[trigger-doc]: /docs/automation/trigger

## Rate limiting updates

When there are entities present in the template and no triggers are defined, the template will be re-rendered when one of the entities changes states. To avoid this taking up too many resources in Home Assistant, rate limiting will be automatically applied if too many states are observed.

<p class='note'>
<a href='#trigger-based-template-sensors'>Define a trigger</a> to avoid a rate limit and get more control over entity updates.
</p>

When `states` is used in a template by itself to iterate all states on the system, the template is re-rendered each
time any state changed event happens if any part of the state is accessed. When merely counting states, the template
is only re-rendered when a state is added or removed from the system. On busy systems with many entities or hundreds of
thousands state changed events per day, templates may re-render more than desirable.

In the below example, re-renders are limited to once per minute because we iterate over all available entities:

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: "Has Unavailable States"
        state: "{{ states | selectattr('state', 'in', ['unavailable', 'unknown', 'none']) | list | count }}"
```

{% endraw %}

In the below example, re-renders are limited to once per second because we iterate over all entities in a single domain (sensor):

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: "Has Unavailable States"
        state: "{{ states.sensor | selectattr('state', 'in', ['unavailable', 'unknown', 'none']) | list | count }}"
```

{% endraw %}

If the template accesses every state on the system, a rate limit of one update per minute is applied. If the template accesses all states under a specific domain, a rate limit of one update per second is applied. If the template only accesses specific states, receives update events for specifically referenced entities, or the `homeassistant.update_entity` service is used, no rate limit is applied.

## Considerations

### Startup

If you are using the state of a platform that might not be available during startup, the Template Sensor may get an `unknown` state. To avoid this, use `is_state()` function in your template. For example, you would replace {% raw %}`{{ states.switch.source.state == 'on' }}`{% endraw %} with this equivalent that returns `true`/`false` and never gives an `unknown` result:

{% raw %}

```yaml
{{ is_state('switch.source', 'on') }}
```

{% endraw %}

## Examples

In this section, you find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

### Storing webhook information

Template entities can be triggered using any automation trigger, including webhook triggers. Use a trigger-based template entity to store this information in template entities.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - trigger:
      - platform: webhook
        webhook_id: my-super-secret-webhook-id
    sensor:
      - name: "Webhook Temperature"
        state: "{{ trigger.json.temperature }}"
        unit_of_measurement: °C

      - name: "Webhook Humidity"
        state: "{{ trigger.json.humidity }}"
        unit_of_measurement: %

    binary_sensor:
      - name: "Motion"
        state: "{{ trigger.json.motion }}"
        device_class: motion
```

{% endraw %}

You can test this trigger entity with the following CURL command:

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"temperature": 5, "humidity": 34, "motion": true}' \
  http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/webhook/my-super-secret-webhook-id
```

### Turning an event into a binary sensor

You can use a trigger-based template entity to convert any event or other automation trigger into a binary sensor. The below configuration will turn on a binary sensor for 5 seconds when the automation trigger triggers.

```yaml
template:
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: my_event
  binary_sensor:
    - name: Event recently fired
      auto_off: 5
      state: "true"
```

### Sun Angle

This example shows the sun angle in the frontend.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: Sun Angle
        unit_of_measurement: "°"
        state: "{{ '%+.1f'|format(state_attr('sun.sun', 'elevation')) }}"
```

{% endraw %}

### Renaming Sensor Output

If you don't like the wording of a sensor output, then the Template Sensor can help too. Let's rename the output of the [Sun component](/integrations/sun/) as a simple example:

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Sun State"
        state: >
          {% if is_state('sun.sun', 'above_horizon') %}
            up
          {% else %}
            down
          {% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

### Multiline Example With an `if` Test

This example shows a multiple line template with an `if` test. It looks at a sensing switch and shows `on`/`off` in the frontend, and shows 'standby' if the power use is less than 1000 watts.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Kettle"
        state: >
          {% if is_state('switch.kettle', 'off') %}
            off
          {% elif state_attr('switch.kettle', 'W')|float < 1000 %}
            standby
          {% elif is_state('switch.kettle', 'on') %}
            on
          {% else %}
            failed
          {% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

### Change The Unit of Measurement

With a Template Sensor, it's easy to convert given values into others if the unit of measurement doesn't fit your needs.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Transmission Down Speed"
        unit_of_measurement: "kB/s"
        state: "{{ states('sensor.transmission_down_speed')|float * 1024 }}"

      - name: "Transmission Up Speed"
        unit_of_measurement: "kB/s"
        state: "{{ states('sensor.transmission_up_speed')|float * 1024 }}"
```

{% endraw %}

### Washing Machine Running

This example creates a washing machine "load running" sensor by monitoring an
energy meter connected to the washer. During the washer's operation, the energy meter will fluctuate wildly, hitting zero frequently even before the load is finished. By utilizing `delay_off`, we can have this sensor only turn off if there has been no washer activity for 5 minutes.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Determine when the washing machine has a load running.
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: "Washing Machine"
        delay_off:
          minutes: 5
        state: >
          {{ states('sensor.washing_machine_power')|float > 0 }}
```

{% endraw %}

### Is Anyone Home

This example is determining if anyone is home based on the combination of device tracking and motion sensors. It's extremely useful if you have kids/baby sitter/grand parents who might still be in your house that aren't represented by a trackable device in Home Assistant. This is providing a composite of Wi-Fi based device tracking and Z-Wave multisensor presence sensors.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: People home
        state: >
          {{ is_state('device_tracker.sean', 'home')
             or is_state('device_tracker.susan', 'home')
             or is_state('binary_sensor.office_124', 'on')
             or is_state('binary_sensor.hallway_134', 'on')
             or is_state('binary_sensor.living_room_139', 'on')
             or is_state('binary_sensor.porch_ms6_1_129', 'on')
             or is_state('binary_sensor.family_room_144', 'on') }}
```

{% endraw %}

### Device Tracker sensor with Latitude and Longitude Attributes

This example shows how to combine a non-GPS (e.g., NMAP) and GPS device tracker while still including latitude and longitude attributes

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: My Device
        state: >
          {{ is_state('device_tracker.my_device_nmap', 'home') or is_state('device_tracker.my_device_gps', 'home') }}
        device_class: "presence"
        attributes:
          latitude: >
            {% if is_state('device_tracker.my_device_nmap', 'home') %}
              {{ state_attr('zone.home', 'latitude') }}
            {% else %}
              {{ state_attr('device_tracker.my_device_gps', 'latitude') }}
            {% endif %}
          longitude: >
            {% if is_state('device_tracker.my_device_nmap', 'home') %}
              {{ state_attr('zone.home', 'longitude') }}
            {% else %}
              {{ state_attr('device_tracker.my_device_gps', 'longitude') }}
            {% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

### Change the icon when a state changes

This example demonstrates how to use template to change the icon as its state changes. This icon is referencing its own state.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: Sun Up
        state: >
          {{ is_state("sun.sun", "above_horizon") }}
        icon: >
          {% if is_state("binary_sensor.sun_up", "on") %}
            mdi:weather-sunset-up
          {% else %}
            mdi:weather-sunset-down
          {% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

## Legacy binary sensor configuration format

_This format still works but is no longer recommended. [Use modern configuration](#configuration-variables)._
