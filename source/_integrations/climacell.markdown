The ClimaCell integration allows you to obtain weather, air quality, pollen, and fire information from the [ClimaCell API](https://www.climacell.co/weather-api/).

## Obtain an API key

You can obtain a free API key by signing up with [ClimaCell](https://developer.climacell.co/sign-up?_ga=2.137889264.1908484805.1591592950-510691096.1591288729).

The integration will automatically set the refresh interval based on the number of ClimaCell integrations that are using the same API key for a given Home Assistant instance. The integration currently assumes you are using a free account so the max requests per day is 100 (the refresh interval is calculated such that you should only use up around 90% of the quota). If you want to use a paid account to increase the number of max requests and increase the update frequency, please open a Home Assistant issue for the integration.
