The `mqtt` Number platform allows you to integrate devices that might expose configuration options through MQTT into Home Assistant as a Number. Every time a message under the `topic` in the configuration is received, the number entity will be updated in Home Assistant and vice-versa, keeping the device and Home Assistant in-sync.

## Configuration

To enable MQTT Number in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
number:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: my-device/threshold
```

{% configuration %}

If set to `all`, `payload_available` must be received on all configured availability topics before the entity is marked as online. If set to `any`, `payload_available` must be received on at least one configured availability topic before the entity is marked as online. If set to `latest`, the last `payload_available` or `payload_not_available` received on any configured availability topic controls the availability.

Make sure that your topic matches exactly. `some-topic/` and `some-topic` are different topics.
