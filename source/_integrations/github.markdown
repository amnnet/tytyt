The GitHub sensor allows you to monitor your favorite [GitHub](https://github.com/) repositories. Monitored information includes the amount of stargazers, forks, open issues and pull requests, the latest commit message, and more. 

## Setup

To set up this sensor you will need a GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). You will need to check the `repo` scope for the sensor to function.

## Configuration

To enable this platform, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: github
    access_token: !secret github_access_token
    repositories:
      - path: 'home-assistant/core'
```
