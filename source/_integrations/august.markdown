## Presence Detection with Lock Operation

Using the lock operation sensors, you can detect when a user operates a lock and is physically present (not remote). The below automation example (added to `automations.yaml`) will trigger when the user named “John Doe” in August locks or unlocks the door from the keypad (if present), via Bluetooth from their phone, or by auto-unlock. The state of the sensor will be the name of the party operating the lock as returned by August.

{% raw %}

```yaml
- id: "1583706446906"
  alias: "joe_doe_front_door_operate"
  description: John Doe locks or unlocks the Front Door
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sensor.front_door_operator
    platform: state
    to: John Doe
  condition:
  - condition: template
    value_template: "{{ not state_attr('sensor.front_door_operator', 'remote') }}"
  action:
  - data: {}
    entity_id: camera.inside
    service: camera.turn_off
```

{% endraw %}
