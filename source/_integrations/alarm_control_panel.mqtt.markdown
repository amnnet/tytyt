The `mqtt` alarm panel platform enables the possibility to control MQTT capable alarm panels. The Alarm icon will change state after receiving a new state from `state_topic`. If these messages are published with *RETAIN* flag, the MQTT alarm panel will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state will be `unknown`.

The integration will accept the following states from your Alarm Panel (in lower case):

- `disarmed`
- `armed_home`
- `armed_away`
- `armed_night`
- `armed_vacation`
- `armed_custom_bypass`
- `pending`
- `triggered`
- `arming`
- `disarming`

The integration can control your Alarm Panel by publishing to the `command_topic` when a user interacts with the Home Assistant frontend.

## Configuration

To enable this platform, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "home/alarm"
    command_topic: "home/alarm/set"
```

{% configuration %}
availability:
  description: A list of MQTT topics subscribed to receive availability (online/offline) updates. Must not be used together with `availability_topic`.

availability_mode:
  description: When `availability` is configured, this controls the conditions needed to set the entity to `available`. Valid entries are `all`, `any`, and `latest`. If set to `all`, `payload_available` must be received on all configured availability topics before the entity is marked as online. If set to `any`, `payload_available` must be received on at least one configured availability topic before the entity is marked as online. If set to `latest`, the last `payload_available` or `payload_not_available` received on any configured availability topic controls the availability.

  required: false

code:
  description: If defined, specifies a code to enable or disable the alarm in the frontend. Note that the code is validated locally and blocks sending MQTT messages to the remote device. For remote code validation, the code can be configured to either of the special values `REMOTE_CODE` (numeric code) or `REMOTE_CODE_TEXT` (text code). In this case, local code validation is bypassed but the frontend will still show a numeric or text code dialog. Use `command_template` to send the code to the remote device. Example configurations for remote code validation [can be found here](./#configurations-with-remote-code-validation).

## Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this alarm control panel.

### Configuration with local code validation

The example below shows a full configuration with local code validation.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example using text based code with local validation configuration.yaml
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Alarm Panel With Numeric Keypad"
    state_topic: "alarmdecoder/panel"
    value_template: "{{value_json.state}}"
    command_topic: "alarmdecoder/panel/set"
    code: mys3cretc0de
```

{% endraw %}

### Configurations with remote code validation

The example below shows a full configuration with local code validation and `command_template`.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example using text code with remote validation configuration.yaml
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Alarm Panel With Text Code Dialog"
    state_topic: "alarmdecoder/panel"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
    command_topic: "alarmdecoder/panel/set"
    code: REMOTE_CODE_TEXT
    command_template: "{ action: '{{ action }}', code: '{{ code }}'}"
```

```yaml
# Example using numeric code with remote validation configuration.yaml
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Alarm Panel With Numeric Keypad"
    state_topic: "alarmdecoder/panel"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.state }}"
    command_topic: "alarmdecoder/panel/set"
    code: REMOTE_CODE
    command_template: "{ action: '{{ action }}', code: '{{ code }}'}"
```

{% endraw %}

When your MQTT connection is not secured, this will send your secret code over the network unprotected!
