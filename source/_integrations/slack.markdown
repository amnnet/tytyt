The `slack` platform allows you to deliver notifications from Home Assistant to [Slack](https://slack.com/).

## Setup

### Bot posting as you

1. Create a [new app](https://api.slack.com/apps) under your Slack.com account.
2. Click the `OAuth & Permissions` link in the sidebar, under the Features heading.
3. In the Scopes section, add the `chat:write` scope, `Send messages as user`. If you get a `missing_scope` error when trying to send a message, check these permissions.
4. Scroll up to `OAuth Tokens & Redirect URLs` and click `Add to Workspace`.
5. Copy your `OAuth Access Token` and put that key into your `configuration.yaml` file -- see below.

<div class='note'>

There is an app credential Verification Token on the Basic Settings of your app. This is **not** the API key you want.

</div>

### Bot posting as its own user

It is also possible to use Slack bots as users. Just create a new bot at https://[YOUR_TEAM].slack.com/apps/build/custom-integration and use the provided token for that. You can add an icon from the frontend for Home Assistant and give the bot a meaningful name.

Don't forget to invite the bot to the room where you want to get the notifications.

## Configuration

To enable the Slack notification in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
    platform: slack
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
    default_channel: "#general"
```

{% configuration %}
name:
  description: Setting this parameter allows multiple notifiers to be created. The notifier will bind to the service `notify.NOTIFIER_NAME`.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "notify"
api_key:
  description: The Slack API token to use for sending Slack messages.
  required: true
  type: string
default_channel:
  description: The default channel to post to if no channel is explicitly specified when sending the notification message.  A channel can be specified adding a target attribute to the JSON at the same level as "message".
  required: true
  type: string
username:
  description: Home Assistant will post to Slack using the username specified.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: The user account or botname that you generated the API key as.
icon:
  description: Use one of the Slack emojis as an Icon for the supplied username.  Slack uses the standard emoji sets used [here](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/). Alternatively a publicly accessible URL may be used.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note'>

Note that in order to modify your Slack bot's username and icon, you must ensure your Slack app has the `chat:write.customize` OAuth scope. See [the Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage#authorship) for more information.

### Slack Service Data

The following attributes can be placed inside the `data` key of the service call for extended functionality:

| Attribute              | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `username`               |      yes | The username of the Slack bot.
| `icon`                   |      yes | The icon of the Slack bot.
| `file`                   |      yes | A file to include with the message; see below.
| `blocks`                 |      yes | Array of [Slack blocks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts). *NOTE*: if using `blocks`, they are shown **in place of** the `message` (note that the `message` is required nonetheless).
| `blocks_template`        |      yes | The same as `blocks`, but able to support [templates](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating).

Note that using `file` will ignore all usage of `blocks` and `blocks_template` (as Slack does not support those frameworks in messages that accompany uploaded files).

To include a local file with the Slack message, use these attributes underneath the `file` key:

| Attribute              | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `path`                   |      no  | A local filepath that has been [whitelisted](/docs/configuration/basic/#allowlist_external_dirs).

To include a remote file with the Slack message, use these attributes underneath the `file` key:

| Attribute              | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `url`                    |      no  | A URL that has been [whitelisted](/docs/configuration/basic/#allowlist_external_urls).
| `username`               |      yes | An optional username if the URL is protected by HTTP Basic Auth.
| `password`               |      yes | An optional password if the URL is protected by HTTP Basic Auth.

### Examples
