## Options

Menu: *Configuration* > *Integrations* > *Select your new integration* > *Press the cog in the upper left corner*

- **select lines**: filter the departures on the station to only show departures for the selected lines.
- **offset**: set this if you want to list the departures some minutes in the future, for example, if you live ten minutes away from the station.
- **use realtime data**: enable this to include delay and cancellation information.

## Elevator sensors

If the selected station has elevators, binary sensors will be available.

### States

- OK (`off`): The elevator is working.
- Problem (`on`): The elevator is out of order. See the cause attribute for more information.
