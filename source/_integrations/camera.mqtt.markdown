The `mqtt` camera platform allows you to integrate the content of an image file sent through MQTT into Home Assistant as a camera. Every time a message under the `topic` in the configuration is received, the image displayed in Home Assistant will also be updated.

This can be used with an application or a service capable of sending images through MQTT.

## Configuration

To enable this camera in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: mqtt
    topic: zanzito/shared_locations/my-device
```
