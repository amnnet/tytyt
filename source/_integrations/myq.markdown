The MyQ integration lets you control MyQ-Enabled garage doors and/or lamps through Home Assistant. Device names in Home Assistant are generated based on the names defined in your MyQ Device mobile app.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

### Binary Sensor

Your MyQ gateway will appear as a binary sensor that shows if the device is connected.

### Cover

Garage doors and gates linked to your `MyQ` account will appear as covers.

### Light

Lamps linked to your `MyQ` account will appear as lights.


## Using HomeKit controller for local control - ***No Apple device required***

If you have a [`819LMB`](https://www.liftmaster.com/myq-home-bridge/p/G819LMB) or [`MYQ-G0303-SP`](https://www.chamberlain.com/myq-g0303-sp/p/MYQ-G0303-SP), Home Assistant can speak HomeKit Accessory Protocol and control the device over the local network without the need to access to the cloud service. As a bonus, updates are push and near-instantaneous.

To use HomeKit Controller:

### If bridge is currently paired (otherwise skip these steps)

- Open the Apple Home App to the Home that the MyQ device is paired with.
- Touch the Home Icon.
- Choose `Home Settings`.
- Scroll down to `Hubs and Bridges`.
- Touch the `MyQ-...` bridge.
- Touch `Remove Bridge from Home`.

### Pairing with Home Assistant

- Go to {% my integrations title="Configuration >> Integrations" %} in the Home Assistant UI.
- Click the button with + sign, and from the list of integrations, select  ***HomeKit Controller***.
- Select the `MyQ-...` bridge.
- Enter the pairing code that is physically printed on a sticker on the bridge.
- Complete the remaining steps.

If you want the devices to be accessible via HomeKit, create a HomeKit Bridge using the following steps:

- Go to {% my integrations title="Configuration >> Integrations" %} in the Home Assistant UI.
- Click the button with + sign, and from the list of integrations, select  ***HomeKit***.
- Create a bridge for the `cover` domain.
- Follow the instructions to pair with the bridge.
