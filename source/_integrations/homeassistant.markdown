The Home Assistant integration provides generic implementations like the generic `homeassistant.turn_on`.

## Services

The `homeassistant` integration provides services for controlling Home Assistant itself, as well as generic controls for any entity.

### Service `homeassistant.check_config`

Reads the configuration files and checks them for correctness, but **does not** load them into Home Assistant. Creates a persistent notification and log entry if errors are found.

### Service `homeassistant.reload_config_entry`

Reloads an integration config entry.

| Service data attribute    | Description                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `entity_id`               | List of entity ids used to reference a config entry.  |
| `area_id`                 | List of area ids used to reference a config entry.    |
| `device_id`               | List of device ids used to reference a config entry.  |

### Service `homeassistant.reload_core_config`

Reloads the core configuration under `homeassistant:` and all linked files. Once loaded the new configuration is applied. New `customize:` information will be applied the next time the state of the entity gets updated.

### Service `homeassistant.restart`

Restarts the Home Assistant instance (also reloading the configuration on start).

This will also do a configuration check before doing a restart. If the configuration check fails then Home Assistant will not be restarted, instead a persistent notification with the ID `persistent_notification.homeassistant_check_config` will be created. The logs will show details on what failed the configuration check.

### Service `homeassistant.stop`

Stops the Home Assistant instance. Home Assistant must be restarted from the Host device to run again.

### Service `homeassistant.set_location`

Update the location of the Home Assistant default zone (usually "Home").

| Service data attribute    | Optional | Description                                           |
|---------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `latitude`                |       no | Latitude of your location.                            |
| `longitude`               |       no | Longitude of your location.                           |

#### Example

```yaml
action:
  service: homeassistant.set_location
  data:
    latitude: 32.87336
    longitude: 117.22743
```

### Service `homeassistant.toggle`

Generic service to toggle devices on/off. Same usage as the
`light.toggle`, `switch.toggle`, etc. services. The difference with this
service compared the others, is that is can be used to mix different domains,
for example, a light and a switch can be toggled in a single service call.

| `entity_id`               |       yes | The entity_id of the device to toggle on/off.         |

#### Example

```yaml
action:
  service: homeassistant.toggle
  target:
    entity_id: 
      - light.living_room
      - switch.tv
```

### Service `homeassistant.turn_on`

Generic service to toggle devices on. Same usage as the
`light.turn_on`, `switch.turn_on`, etc. services. The difference with this
service compared the others, is that is can be used to mix different domains,
for example, a light and a switch can be turned on in a single service call.

| Service data attribute    | Optional | Description                                           |
|---------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `entity_id`               |       yes | The entity_id of the device to turn on.               |

#### Example

```yaml
action:
  service: homeassistant.turn_on
  target:
    entity_id:
      - light.living_room
      - switch.tv
```

### Service `homeassistant.turn_off` 

Generic service to toggle devices off. Same usage as the
`light.turn_off`, `switch.turn_off`, etc. services. The difference with this

  service: homeassistant.turn_off
  target:
    entity_id:
      - light.living_room

```

### Service `homeassistant.update_entity`

Force one or more entities to update its data rather than wait for the next scheduled update.

| Service data attribute    | Optional | Description                                           |

    - switch.coffe_pot

### Service `homeassistant.save_persistent_states`

Save the persistent states (for entities derived from RestoreEntity) immediately.
Maintain the normal periodic saving interval.

Normally these states are saved at startup, every 15 minutes and at shutdown.
