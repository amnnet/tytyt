The Control4 integration allows you to control and monitor lights from your local Control4 system. Your Control4 controller must be running OS 3.0+.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up, you should assign a static IP address/DHCP reservation on your router to your Control4 controller. Home Assistant must be able to communicate with the controller over the local network; 4Sight remote access is not supported.
