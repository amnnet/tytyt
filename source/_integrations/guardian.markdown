The `guardian` integration integrates
[Elexa Guardian water valve controllers](https://getguardian.com) into Home Assistant.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Binary Sensor**: reports the status of the onboard leak detector and access point
- **Sensor**: reports on the device's detected temperature and uptime
- **Switch**: allows the user to open and close the valve

bugs related to non-working service calls.

## Paired Sensor Notes

When a paired sensor is first added to the valve controller, it may return inaccurate or
nonsensical values for several of its attributes, such as `battery` and `temperature`. This
is due to the sensor never having communicated its data to the valve controller and can
be fixed by moving the sensor around (so that it beeps, indicating that data has been
sent to the valve controller).
