The `braviatv` platform allows you to control a [Sony Bravia TV](https://www.sony.com/).

Almost all [Sony Bravia TV 2013 and newer](https://info.tvsideview.sony.net/en_ww/home_device.html#bravia) are supported. A more generic method for older TVs connected to a Raspberry Pi with HDMI-CEC is explained further [below](#for-tvs-older-than-2013).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Common Issues

### Previous Configurations

To ensure a clean re-configuration, please perform the following steps:

- Remove the entities you are reconfiguring from Home Assistant.
- Restart Home Assistant.
- Perform the [TV does not generate new pin](#tv-does-not-generate-new-pin) steps.
- Retry [configuration](#configuration).

### TV does not generate new pin

If you have previously set up your TV with any Home Assistant instances, you must remove Home Assistant from your TV in order for your TV to generate a new pin. To do this, you must do **one** of the following:

- On your TV, go to: **Settings** -> **Network** -> **Remote device settings** -> **Deregister remote device**. Disable and re-enable the **Control remotely** after. Menu titles may differ slightly between models. If needed, refer to your specific model's [manual](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/manuals) for additional guidance.
- Reset your TV to factory condition.

## Remote

When the integration is configured, two entities will be created: a `media_player` and a `remote`. The remote allows you to send key commands to your TV with the `remote.send_command` service.

Some of the known valid key values are (may depend on your TV model):

- `Num1`
- `Num2`
- `Num3`
- `Num4`

## Extra configuration for the integration

The integration allows you to change ignored TV sources from the front end. Enter which Sony Bravia TV integration you want to change options on and press the cog wheel.

### For TVs older than 2013

<div class='note warning'>

This is not part of the Bravia TV integration. Extra Configuration does not apply to the steps below.

</div>

Users of TVs older than 2013 have another option for controlling their TV via Home Assistant.

### Using HDMI-CEC

If you have a Raspberry Pi connected to your TV:

{% raw %}

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: command_line
    switches:
      tv_rpi:
        command_on: ssh root@[IP] "echo 'on 0' | cec-client -s"
        command_off: ssh root@[IP] "echo 'standby 0' | cec-client -s"
        command_state: ssh root@[IP] "echo 'pow 0' | cec-client -s |grep 'power status:'"
        value_template: '{{ value == "power status: on" }}'
```

{% endraw %}

Using `cec-client` is a great method to turn your TV off/on, however the trade off is if you're using Kodi, it will no longer be able to control your TV using the TV Remote.

This is because only one process can control the CEC functionality within the Raspberry Pi at a time and running the above commands terminates the functionality inside libCEC within Kodi. Kodi must be restarted for TV remove functionality to work again.

#### Workaround

If your desire is only to turn on your TV, the following "workaround" may be desirable:

Change the 'on' command to a restart for Kodi. This doesn't reboot the Kodi device.

Restarting Kodi will trigger a HDMI-CEC event to bring the TV out of standby. The following can replace your TV 'on' command.

```yaml
command_on: ssh root@[IP] "systemctl restart kodi"
```
