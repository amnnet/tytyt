Groups allow the user to combine multiple entities into one.

Check **Developer Tools** -> **States** and browse the **Current entities:** listing for all available entities.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
group:
  kitchen:
    name: Kitchen
    entities:
      - switch.kitchen_pin_3
  climate:
    name: Climate
    entities:
      - sensor.bedroom_temp
      - sensor.porch_temp
  awesome_people:
    name: Awesome People
    entities:
      - device_tracker.dad_smith
      - device_tracker.mom_smith
```

## Group behavior

By default when any member of a group is `on` then the group will also be `on`. Similarly with a device tracker, when any member of the group is `home` then the group is `home`. If you set the `all` option to `true` though, this behavior is inverted and all members of the group have to be `on` for the group to turn on as well.

## Group state calculation

The system can calculate group state with entities from the following domains:

* alarm_control_panel
* binary_sensor
* climate
* cover
* device_tracker
* fan
* humidifier
* light
* lock
* media_player
* person
* plant
* remote
* switch
* vacuum
* water_heater

When entities all have a single on and off state, the group state will
be calculated as follows:

| Domain            | on     | off      |
|-------------------|--------|----------|
| device_tracker    | home   | not_home |
| cover             | open   | closed   |
| lock              | locked | unlocked |
| person            | home   | not_home |
| media_player      | ok     | problem  |

When a group contains entities from domains that have multiple `on` states or only use `on`
and `off`, the group state will be `on` or `off`.

It is possible to create a group that the system cannot calculate a group state.
Groups with entities from unsupported domains will always have an unknown state.

These groups can still be in templates with the `expand()` directive, called using the
`homeassistant.turn_on` and `homeassistant.turn_off` services, etc.
