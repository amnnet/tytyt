The `iss` platform uses the
[Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/)
to let you know if the station is above your home location.
This means that ISS is 10Â° above the horizon of your home.

You can check in the attributes of the sensor to see the timestamp for the next
rise of the station, its current coordinates, and the number of people in space.

## Configuration

To add ISS binary sensor to your installation,
add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: iss
```

{% configuration %}
name:
  description: The name for this sensor in the frontend.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: ISS
show_on_map:
  description: Option to show the position of the ISS on the map.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note warning'>

If you set `show_on_map: true` then the location attributes are named `latitude` and `longitude`.
The default name of the location attributes is `lat` and `long` to avoid showing them on the map.

</div>
