The `nexia` integration allows you to integrate your [Nexia](https://mynexia.com/) (Trane) thermostats or [American Standard](https://asairhome.com/) thermostats into Home Assistant.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary Sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Climate](#climate)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Scene](#scene)

- Blower Active

### Sensor

The following binary sensors are added for each thermostat:

The following binary sensors are added for each thermostat zone:

- Zone Temperature
- Zone Setpoint Status
- Zone Status

### Climate

The `nexia` climate platform lets you control a thermostat.

The following Trane thermostats are supported: `XL1050`, `XL850`, `XL824`

The following American Standard thermostats have been reported to work: `AZONE1050`, `AZONE850`, `ACONT824`
