This offers a map on the frontend to display the location of tracked devices. To set up tracked devices, look at the [device tracker](/integrations/device_tracker/) documentation. This integration is by default enabled, unless you've disabled or removed the [`default_config:`](/integrations/default_config/) line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
map:
```

<div class='note'>
Devices that are currently at home won't show on the map.
</div>

<div class='note'>
  
This map always shows the location of all tracked devices. If you want to hide certain entities, you should look into the [Map Card](/lovelace/map/).

</div>
