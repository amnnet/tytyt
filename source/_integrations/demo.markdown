The `demo` platform allows you to use integrations which are providing a demo of their implementation. The demo entities are dummies but show you how the actual platform looks like. This way you can run own demonstration instance like the online [Home Assistant demo](/demo/) but combined with your own real/functional platforms.

Available demo platforms:

- [Air Quality](/integrations/air_quality/) (`air_quality`)
- [Alarm control panel](/integrations/alarm_control_panel/) (`alarm_control_panel`)
- [Binary sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor/) (`binary_sensor`)
- [Camera](/integrations/camera/) (`camera`)
- [Climate](/integrations/climate/) (`climate`)
- [Cover](/integrations/cover/) (`cover`)
- [Fan](/integrations/fan/) (`fan`)
- [Geolocation](/integrations/geo_location/) (`geo_location`)
- [Humidifier](/integrations/humidifier/) (`humidifier`)
- [Image Processing](/integrations/image_processing/) (`image_processing`)
- [Light](/integrations/light/) (`light`)
- [Lock](/integrations/lock/) (`lock`)
- [Mailbox](/integrations/mailbox/) (`mailbox`)
- [Media Player](/integrations/media_player/) (`media_player`)
- [Notification](/integrations/notify/) (`notify`)
- [Number](/integrations/number/) (`number`)
- [Remote](/integrations/remote/) (`remote`)
- [Sensor](/integrations/sensor/) (`sensor`)
- [Switch](/integrations/switch/) (`switch`)
- [Text-to-speech](/integrations/tts/) (`tts`)
- [Weather](/integrations/weather/) (`weather`)

To integrate a demo platform in Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

# To load all:
demo:

# To load for a specific integration:
light:
  - platform: demo
```

{% configuration %}
"[component]":

  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}
