If your home is fitted with [SmartHab](https://smarthab.fr/index.php/home-en)'s 
devices and you have access to their app-based services, you will be able 
to control your lights and shutters with the SmartHab integration for Home 
Assistant.

<div class='note warning'>
  To prevent being automatically logged out of your SmartHab mobile app, you
  might want to create a secondary user in the app's settings and grant it
  access to your home. You can then configure the integration using this account's
  credentials. This is also more secure, as this user should be less privileged.
