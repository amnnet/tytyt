The Environment Canada integration provides meteorological data for Canadian locations from [Environment and Climate Change Canada](https://weather.gc.ca/index_e.html).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Location Selection

The integration automatically determines the closest weather station based on the latitude and longitude specified. If integration-specific coordinates are not provided, the coordinates configured for Home Assistant are used.

You can also specify a weather station to use by providing a identification code of the form `AB/s0000123`, based on those listed in [this CSV file](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/citypage_weather/docs/site_list_towns_en.csv).

## Entities

The integration will create the entities listed below. Note that many of the entities are disabled by default and can be enabled via the Configuration / Entities screen.

### Weather

- Current conditions and daily forecast
- Current conditions and hourly forecast

### Camera

- Loop of radar imagery from the last 3 hours

By default, the radar entity uses the rain layer from 1 April to 30 November and the snow layer from 1 December to 31 March.

### Sensors

#### Conditions and Forecasts

- Current condition
- Forecast summary
- [Icon code](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/citypage_weather/docs/Current_Conditions_Icons-Icones_conditions_actuelles.pdf) of current condition
- Barometric pressure
- Pressure tendency
- Humidity
- Visibility
- UV index

#### Temperature

- Temperature
- Wind chill
- Humidex
- Forecast high temperature
- Forecast low temperature
- Dewpoint

#### Wind

- Wind speed
- Wind gust
- Wind direction
- Wind bearing

#### Precipitation

- Probability of precipitation
- Precipitation yesterday

#### Alerts

- Warnings
- Watches
- Advisories
- Statements
- Endings

The alert sensors use the number of current alerts as their state, with an attribute containing the title of each alert.

## Template Sensors

The configuration snippet below adds a useful [template sensors](/integrations/template/) showing the current "feels like" temperature among air temperature, humidex, and wind chill.

Replace `NAME` with the name used to configure your integration.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
    - name: "Feels Like"
      device_class: temperature
      unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
      state: >
        {% if not is_state('sensor.NAME_humidex', 'unknown') %}
          {{ states('sensor.NAME_humidex') }}
        {% elif not is_state('sensor.NAME_wind_chill', 'unknown') %}
          {{ states('sensor.NAME_wind_chill') }}
        {% else %}
          {{ states('sensor.NAME_temperature') | round(0) }}
        {% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}
