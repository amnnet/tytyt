The Kostal Plenticore integration allows you to get data from [Kostal Plenticore](https://www.kostal-solar-electric.com/) solar inverters and integrate them into your Home Assistant installation. It allows you also to change some of settings values of the inverter.

The integration uses the REST-API interface which is also used by the integrated Web-UI and therefore uses the same password.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Sensors

The integration disables most of the sensors per default. You can enable it in the *Entity* page. The sensors are split into two sets, one for the process data and one for the setting values.

<div class='note'>
The Plenticore inverter provides much more data endpoints, some of them are also dependent of the version of the firmware. If you are missing process data values, open an issue with the necessary information or make an pull request.
