## Binary Sensor

The `pi4ioe5v9xxxx` binary sensor platform allows you to read sensor values from the I/O pins of your I/O expander.

The pin numbers are from 1 to X where: 1-8 correspond to port 0 (00-07) and 9-16 to port 1, etc.

### Configuration

To use the I/O pins of a pi4ioe5v9xxxx connected to an I2C bus of your Raspberry Pi as binary sensors, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
- platform: pi4ioe5v9xxxx
  pins:
    1: Pin_01/PI0_0
    2: Pin_02/PI0_1
    3: Pin_03/PI0_2
    4: Pin_04/PI0_3
    5: Pin_05/PI0_4
    6: Pin_06/PI0_5
    7: Pin_07/PI0_6
    8: Pin_08/PI0_7
```

  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: "`false` (ACTIVE HIGH)"
{% endconfiguration %}


## Switch

The `pi4ioe5v9xxxx` switch platform allows you to write to the I/O pins of your I2C I/O expander.

The pin numbers are from 1 to X, where 1-8 correspond to port A (A1-A8) and 9-16 to port B (B1-B8), etc.

### Configuration

To use the I/O pins of a pi4ioe5v9xxxx connected to an I2C bus as switches, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: pi4ioe5v9xxxx
    pins:
     1: Pin_01/PI0_0
     2: Pin_02/PI0_1
     3: Pin_03/PI0_2
     4: Pin_04/PI0_3
     5: Pin_05/PI0_4
     6: Pin_06/PI0_5
     7: Pin_07/PI0_6
     8: Pin_08/PI0_7
```
