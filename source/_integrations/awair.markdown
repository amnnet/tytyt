The Awair integration will fetch data from your [Awair devices](https://getawair.com).

You will need to request access to the Awair API and obtain an access token from the Awair [Developer Console](https://developer.getawair.com/). It is free, but getting a token can take up to 24 hours.

## Available Sensors

The integration will fetch data from each device linked to your Awair developer account. The following sensors are supported:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Carbon dioxide
* Total volatile organic compounds
* PM2.5 density
* PM10 density
* Sound level
* Luminescence

Not all devices support all sensors; consult Awair's documentation to find out what sensors are present on your device. For first-generation Awair devices with a "dust" sensor, the integration will create identical PM2.5 and PM10 sensors (which reflects the capabilities of the sensor - it can detect dust between PM2.5 and PM10 but cannot differentiate between them).

This integration refreshes once every 5 minutes, based on the [default per-device quota](https://docs.developer.getawair.com/?version=latest#tiers--quotas) of 300 API calls per day.
