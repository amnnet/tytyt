The Honeywell Lyric integration integrates the Lyric thermostat platform into Home Assistant.

## Setup

To set up this component, you first **must** set up a developer account with Honeywell:

1. Go to the [developer site](https://developer.honeywellhome.com) and register with an account.
1. Next, create a [new app](https://developer.honeywellhome.com/user/me/apps/add) via the `My Apps` section.
   1. App Name: You can use any name here.
   1. Callback URL: This needs to be the URL of your Home Assistant instance + `/auth/external/callback`. For example: `http://192.168.1.123:8123/auth/external/callback`.

Once your app is created, copy the `Consumer Key` and `Consumer Secret`. These will be your `client_id` and `client_secret` to add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
lyric:
  client_id: MY_CONSUMER_KEY
  client_secret: MY_CONSUMER_SECRET
```

You should now restart the server.

You can then add the integration in the frontend via the steps below.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}
