The `mqtt` device tracker platform allows you to define new device_trackers through [manual YAML configuration](#yaml-configuration) in `configuration.yaml` and also to automatically discover device_trackers through a [discovery schema](#discovery-schema) using the MQTT Discovery protocol.

## YAML Configuration

To use this device tracker in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: mqtt
    devices:
      paulus_oneplus: "location/paulus"
      annetherese_n4: "location/annetherese"
```

{% configuration %}
devices:
  description: List of devices with their topic.
  required: true
  type: list
qos:
  description: The QoS level of the topic.
  required: false
  type: integer
payload_home:
  description: The payload value that represents the 'home' state for the device.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "home"
payload_not_home:
  description: The payload value that represents the 'not_home' state for the device.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "not_home"
source_type:
  description: Attribute of a device tracker that affects state when being used to track a [person](/integrations/person/). Valid options are `gps`, `router`, `bluetooth`, or `bluetooth_le`.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Complete YAML example configuration

```yaml
# Complete configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: mqtt
    devices:
      paulus_oneplus: "location/paulus"
      annetherese_n4: "location/annetherese"
    qos: 1
    payload_home: "present"
    payload_not_home: "not present"
    source_type: bluetooth
```

## YAML Usage

To set the state of the device_tracker then you need to publish a JSON message to the topic (e.g., via mqtt.publish service). As an example, the following JSON message would set the `paulus_oneplus` device_tracker to `home`:

```json
{
  "topic": "location/paulus",
  "payload": "present"
}
```

## Discovery Schema

MQTT device_trackers are also supported through [MQTT discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/). This is different to the YAML configuration from above. Here, the device_tracker can be created via a discovery topic that follows the following topic name convention: `<discovery_prefix>/device_tracker/[<node_id>/]<object_id>/config` and the JSON message content of a specific format as defined below.

If set to `all`, `payload_available` must be received on all configured availability topics before the entity is marked as online. If set to `any`, `payload_available` must be received on at least one configured availability topic before the entity is marked as online. If set to `latest`, the last `payload_available` or `payload_not_available` received on any configured availability topic controls the availability.

## Discovery Example

You can use the discovery protocol to create a new device tracker and set its state using the command line tool `mosquitto_pub` shipped with `mosquitto` or the `mosquitto-clients` package to send MQTT messages.

To create the device_tracker:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t home-assistant/device_tracker/a4567d663eaf/config -m '{"state_topic": "a4567d663eaf/state", "name": "My Tracker", "payload_home": "home", "payload_not_home": "not_home"}'
```

To set the state of the device tracker to "home":

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t a4567d663eaf/state -m 'home'
```
