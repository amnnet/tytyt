## Power state

Arcam FMJ receivers turn off their network port when in standby, the component will try to reconnect to the receiver every 5 seconds. This means powering on the first zone is not possible over the built-in network connection. Two options for complete power control exists: IR or Serial gateway.

### IR command

Use an IR blaster to send a command to turn the device on using these discrete codes:

- Zone 1: Protocol: RC5 Device: 16 Function: 123
- Zone 2: Protocol: RC5 Device: 23 Function: 123

Turn on sometime requires two IR codes to be sent. You can generate the raw, broadlink or other IR format string using [irgen](https://github.com/elupus/irgen) tool like:

```shell
irgen -i rc5 -d 16 0 123 -o broadlink_base64 -r 2
```

To trigger this IR command add an automation on the event `arcam.turn_on` filtering on
the `entity_id` of the `media_player` zone entity. This can be added using device automations
or manually using normal automations.

### Serial Port to network gateway

Use a network to a serial port gateway to connect to the serial port of the
receiver. The serial port is always available and can power on the device.
This is the most reliable communication method as well.
