The `tplink` integration allows you to control your [TP-Link Smart Home Devices](https://www.tp-link.com/kasa-smart/) such as plugs, power strips, wall switches and bulbs.

You need to provision your newly purchased device to connect to your network before it can be added via the integration. This can be done either by using [kasa command-line tool](https://python-kasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#provisioning) or by adding it to the official Kasa app before trying to add them to Home Assistant. If you use the app, do not upgrade the firmware if it presents the option to avoid blocking the local access by potential firmware updates.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Light**
- **Switch**
- **Sensor**
