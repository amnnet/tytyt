The `panel_custom` integration allows you to write your own panels in JavaScript and add them to Home Assistant. See the developer documentation on [instructions how to build your own panels](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/creating-custom-panels/).

To enable customized panels in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
panel_custom:
  - name: my-panel
    sidebar_title: TodoMVC
    sidebar_icon: mdi:work
    url_path: my-todomvc
    module_url: /local/my-panel.js
    config:
      who: world
```

<div class='note'>

Store your custom panels in `<config>/www` to make them available in the frontend at the path `/local`.

</div>
