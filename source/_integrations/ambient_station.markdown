The `Ambient Weather Station` integration retrieves local weather information
via personal weather stations from [Ambient Weather](https://ambientweather.net).

## Prerequisites

Using this integration requires both an Application Key and an API Key. To
generate both, simply utilize the profile section of
[your Ambient Weather dashboard](https://dashboard.ambientweather.net).

To add your Ambient Weather PWS to your Home Assistant installation, add the
following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
ambient_station:
  api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
  app_key: YOUR_APPLICATION_KEY
```

{% configuration %}
api_key:
  description: The API key to access the service.
  required: true
  type: string
app_key:
  description: The Application key to access the service.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Local API Option

This integration communicates with Ambient Weather PWS units via the Ambient Weather
Cloud. Users wishing to explore a local option are encouraged to explore the
[Ecowitt GW1000](https://www.ecowitt.com/shop/goodsDetail/16), a small device that is
able to read RF signals directly from the PWS and transmit them to a variety of
other applications, including [`ecowitt2mqtt`](https://github.com/bachya/ecowitt2mqtt)
(which supports [MQTT Discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery)).
