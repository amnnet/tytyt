The `onvif` camera platform allows you to use an [ONVIF](https://www.onvif.org/) Profile S conformant device in Home Assistant. This requires the [`ffmpeg` component](/integrations/ffmpeg/) to be already configured.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

<div class='note'>
  It is recommended that you create a user on your device specifically for Home Assistant. For all current functionality, it is enough to create a standard user.

<div class='note'>
If running Home assistant Core in a venv, ensure that libxml2 and libxslt python interfaces are installed via your package manager.

### Configuration Notes

Most of the ONVIF devices support more than one audio/video profile. Each profile provides different image quality, or in the case of an NVR, separate connected cameras. This integration will add entities for all compatible profiles with the video encoding set to H.264. Usually, the first profile has the highest quality and it is the profile used by default. However, you may want to use a lower quality image. You may disable unwanted entities through the Home Assistant UI.

### Extra configuration of the integration

You can configure specific FFmpeg options through the integration options flow by clicking the gear icon on the top right of the integration details page.

| Option | Description |
| -------| ----------- |
| RTSP transport mechanism | RTSP transport protocols. The possible options are: `tcp`, `udp`, `udp_multicast`, `http`. |
| Extra FFmpeg arguments | Extra options to pass to `ffmpeg`, e.g., image quality or video filter options. More details in [`ffmpeg` component](/integrations/ffmpeg). |

### Supported Sensors

This integration uses the ONVIF pullpoint subscription API to process events into sensors that will be automatically added to Home Assistant.  Below is a list of currently supported event topics along with the entities they create.

To help with development of this component, enable `info` level logging for `homeassistant.components.onvif` and create an issue on GitHub for any messages that show _"No registered handler for event"_.

| Topic(s) | Entity Type | Device Class | Description |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `tns1:VideoSource/MotionAlarm` | Binary Sensor | Motion | Generic motion alarm. |
| `tns1:RuleEngine/FieldDetector/ObjectsInside` | Binary Sensor | Motion | Polygonal field detection determines if each object in the scene is inside or outside the polygon. |
| `tns1:RuleEngine/CellMotionDetector/Motion` | Binary Sensor | Motion | Cell based motion detection determined by placing a grid over the video source and determining changes. |
| `tns1:AudioAnalytics/Audio/DetectedSound` | Binary Sensor | Sound | Device detected sound. |
| `tns1:VideoSource/ImageTooBlurry/AnalyticsService`<br>`tns1:VideoSource/ImageTooBlurry/ImagingService`<br>`tns1:VideoSource/ImageTooBlurry/RecordingService` | Binary Sensor | Problem | Device reports blurry image. |
| `tns1:VideoSource/ImageTooDark/AnalyticsService`<br>`tns1:VideoSource/ImageTooDark/ImagingService`<br>`tns1:VideoSource/ImageTooDark/RecordingService` | Binary Sensor | Problem | Device reports dark image. |
| `tns1:VideoSource/ImageTooBright/AnalyticsService`<br>`tns1:VideoSource/ImageTooBright/ImagingService`<br>`tns1:VideoSource/ImageTooBright/RecordingService` | Binary Sensor | Problem | Device reports bright image. |
| `tns1:VideoSource/GlobalSceneChange/AnalyticsService`<br>`tns1:VideoSource/GlobalSceneChange/ImagingService`<br>`tns1:VideoSource/GlobalSceneChange/RecordingService` | Binary Sensor | Problem | Device reports a large portion of the video content changing.  The cause can be tamper actions like camera movement or coverage. |
| `tns1:RuleEngine/TamperDetector/Tamper` | Binary Sensor | Problem | Tamper Detection. |
| `tns1:Device/HardwareFailure/StorageFailure` | Binary Sensor | Problem | Storage failure on device. |
| `tns1:Monitoring/ProcessorUsage` | Sensor | Percent | Device processor usage. |
| `tns1:Monitoring/OperatingTime/LastReboot` | Sensor | Timestamp | When the device was last rebooted. |
| `tns1:Monitoring/OperatingTime/LastReset` | Sensor | Timestamp | When the device was last reset. |
| `tns1:Monitoring/OperatingTime/LastClockSynchronization` | Sensor | Timestamp | When the device clock was last synchronized. |

### Service `onvif.ptz`

If your ONVIF camera supports PTZ, you will be able to pan, tilt or zoom your camera.

| Service data attribute | Description |
| -----------------------| ----------- |
| `entity_id` | String or list of strings that point at `entity_id`s of cameras. Use `entity_id: all` to target all. |
| `tilt` | Tilt direction. Allowed values: `UP`, `DOWN`, `NONE` |
| `pan` | Pan direction. Allowed values: `RIGHT`, `LEFT`, `NONE` |
| `zoom` | Zoom. Allowed values: `ZOOM_IN`, `ZOOM_OUT`, `NONE` |
| `distance` | Distance coefficient. Sets how much PTZ should be executed in one request. Allowed values: floating point numbers, 0 to 1. Default : 0.1 |
| `speed` | Speed coefficient. Sets how fast PTZ will be executed. Allowed values: floating point numbers, 0 to 1. Default : 0.5 |
| `preset` | PTZ preset profile token. Sets the preset profile token which is executed with GotoPreset. |
| `move_mode` | PTZ moving mode. Allowed values: `ContinuousMove`, `RelativeMove`, `AbsoluteMove`, `GotoPreset`, `Stop`. Default :`RelativeMove` |
| `continuous_duration` | Set ContinuousMove delay in seconds before stopping the move. Allowed values: floating point numbers or integer. Default : 0.5 |

If you are running into trouble with this sensor, please refer to the [Troubleshooting section](/integrations/ffmpeg/#troubleshooting).
