The Home+ Control integration platform allows you to control a range of Legrand in-wall switches and power outlets that have smart home functionality thanks to their "with Netatmo" capabilities.

This integration works against the Home+ Control API, which is one of the many APIs offered through the [*Works with Legrand*](https://developer.legrand.com/) program. The API is capable of managing "Legrand/Btcino with Netatmo" devices, such as light switches, power outlets and rolling shutters.

The devices that this API can manage are offered in different designs across different countries. The details of these can be found [here](https://developer.legrand.com/solutions/wiring-devices-with-netatmo/).

This Home+ Control integration for Home Assistant currently has support for the following devices:

- Light switches
- Power outlets

In both cases, the devices are modeled as on/off switches within Home Assistant.

This integration has been tested to work with the following range of Legrand products

- Valena Nextâ„¢ with Netatmo

This integration has also been tested to work with the following range of BTicino products

- Living Now (Light switches)

## Authentication

Before you are able to configure the Legrand Home + Control integration into Home Assistant, you must register with the *Works with Legrand* platform.

These Legrand APIs rely on Oauth2 authentication, so you must follow these steps to obtain the necessary authentication parameters:

1. Register an account at <https://developer.legrand.com>.
2. Create a subscription to the *Starter Kit* (currently the only subscription available) and this will generate your `SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`.
3. Register an application, where you will have to define a name, a redirect URL and the scopes of your application. When selecting the scopes, be sure to include all of the `.read` scopes, as well as the `light.write` and `plug.write` scopes to be able to control these modules from the integration.

Once the registered application is confirmed, you should receive an email containing the `CLIENT_IDENTIFIER` and the `CLIENT_SECRET` which you will be using to set up the authentication flows. The application confirmation email is usually received within a few hours of having issued the request.

Finally, to set up Oauth2 authentication in Home Assistant you should add the following information to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
home_plus_control:
  client_id: CLIENT_IDENTIFIER
  client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET
  subscription_key: SUBSCRIPTION_KEY
```

{% configuration %}
client_id:
  description: Client identifier for your registered application on the *Works with Legrand* platform. Received via email.
  required: true
  type: string
client_secret:
  description: Client secret for your registered application on the *Works with Legrand* platform. Received via email.
  required: true
  type: string
subscription_key:
  description: Subscription identifier for your registered account on the *Works with Legrand* platform. Provided upon registration.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

Restart Home Assistant after changing the YAML configuration. At this point, you are now ready to add the Home+ Control integration to your Home Assistant instance as described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## API Nomenclature

Within the context of the Home+ Control API you may come across the following terms:

- *Plant*: This is the term used to represent a *home* that holds the Legrand devices. In practice, a *plant* is represented by the *Legrand Home+ Control* gateway that acts as the central hub of the rest of the devices in the home network (uses Zigbee).
- *Module*: This is the term used to represent a generic device within the *plant*, i.e., a light, a plug, a remote, etc.
- *Light*: This is the term used to represent a light switch (or a micro-module). It is not modeled as your usual light entity because there are no brightness, color, etc. controls. It is modeled as an on/off switch.
- *Plug*: This is the term used to represent a power outlet.

Other devices that are mentioned in the API, but that are not currently supported by this integration are: *remotes* (wireless switches), *heaters* and *automations*.

## API Limitations

As described in the [authentication](#authentication) section, this integration requires you to set up a subscription in the *Works with Legrand* platform.

Currently, end-users only have access to the *Starter Kit* subscription which has a major limitation in the number of allowed API requests that are allowed - only 500 API calls per day (counter is reset at 00:00 every day). If this daily quota is ever exceeded, the API will report `403 Forbidden` HTTP responses.
