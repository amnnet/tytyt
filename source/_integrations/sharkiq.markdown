The `sharkiq` integration allows you to control your [Shark IQ](https://www.sharkclean.com/vacuums/robot-vacuums/) vacuum.

This platform has been tested and is confirmed to be working with the Shark IQ R101AE robot vacuum with self-empty base but should also work with the R100.

## Services

Currently supported services are:

- `start`
- `pause`
- `stop`
- `return_to_base`
- `locate`

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Disconnecting

If the integration frequently disconnects and you have an ad blocker runner like [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) or [AdGuard](https://adguard.com) add `ads-field.aylanetworks.com` to the Allow list . This domain is needed for the connection and can be part of the automatic blocking because of `ads` being part of the subdomain.
