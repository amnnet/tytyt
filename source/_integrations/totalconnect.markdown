The `totalconnect` integration provides connectivity with TotalConnect alarm systems used by many alarm companies.

## Prerequisites

Log in to the [TotalConnect website](https://totalconnect2.com) and create a "standard" Total Connect user account specifically for use with Home Assistant. It should not have full administrative privileges.

Give the user access to your Location. Give the user a usercode, usually a 4 digit number.

## Automation example

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Alarm: Disarmed Daytime"
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: alarm_control_panel.total_connect
      to: "disarmed"
    condition:
      condition: sun
      before: sunset
    action:
      service: scene.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: scene.OnDisarmedDaytime
  - alias: "Alarm: Armed Away"
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: alarm_control_panel.total_connect
      to: "armed_away"
    action:
      service: scene.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: scene.OnArmedAway
```

{% details "Notes for Home Assistant Core Installations" %}

If you have issues running this component, you may require `libxml2-dev` and `libxmlsec1-dev` packages. To install these on Raspbian, run the command:

```bash
sudo apt install libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev
```

{% enddetails %}

## Alarm Control Panel

The integration provides an Alarm Control Panel for each TotalConnect location. It uses the name of your location from TotalConnect.  For example, if your location name in TotalConnect is "Home", then you will get `alarm_control_panel.home` in Home Assistant.

The alarm control panel supports the following services: `alarm_arm_away`, `alarm_arm_home`, `alarm_arm_night` and `alarm_disarm`.

The `triggered` state also provides a state attribute called `triggered_source` giving more detail on what triggered the alarm:

- `Police/Medical` is when sensors detected a burglar and/or a person pushed the Police or Medical button
- `Fire/Smoke` is when fire or smoke is detected, or a person pushed the Fire button
- `Carbon Monoxide` is when carbon monoxide is detected

## Binary Sensor

The integration provides a Binary Sensor for each TotalConnect zone. To see zones in TotalConnect "fault" status, your TotalConnect account must have "Sensor Events" enabled. Your alarm monitoring company may charge an extra fee to enable this. If available, these can be found in the Total Connect 2 web portal at **Notifications** -> **Sensor Events**. Alternately, they can be found in the Total Connect iOS app at **More** -> **Settings** -> **Notifications** -> **Sensor Events**. Enable each zone you want to monitor. TotalConnect zones will display as `Closed` in Home Assistant unless the Sensor Event is enabled.

The TotalConnect API has limited zone type information. Home Assistant device class `door` is assigned to TotalConnect door, window, perimeter, motion sensor, and most alarm panel buttons. The sensor will appear as `True` if the door is open (either fault or triggered in TotalConnect) and `False` otherwise. Device class `smoke` is assigned to TotalConnect smoke detectors and buttons with physical alarm panel "Response Type" setting of "Fire No Verification". The sensor will appear as `True` if smoke is detected.  Device class `gas` is assigned to TotalConnect carbon monoxide detectors. The sensor will appear as `True` if gas is detected.
