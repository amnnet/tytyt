The Flux LED integration supports several brands of switches, bulbs, and controllers that use the same protocol and have the HF-LPB100 chipset in common. Chances are high that your bulb or controller (eg. WiFi LED CONTROLLER) will work with this integration if you can control the device with the MagicHome app.

This integration will provide local control over your LED lights/strips and can be configured to auto-scan your network for controllers or for you to manually configure individual lights by their IP address.

Example of bulbs:

- [Flux Smart Lighting](https://www.fluxsmartlighting.com/)
- [Flux WiFi Smart LED Light Bulb4](https://amzn.to/2X0dVwu)
- [WIFI smart LED light Bulb1](https://amzn.to/2J2fksr)

Examples of controllers:

- [Ledenet WiFi RGBW Controller](https://amzn.to/2WZKXNa)
- [SUPERNIGHT WiFi Wireless LED Smart Controller](https://amzn.to/2WURx7w)

After the devices have been added they can be configured with different effects listed below. These settings can be accessed by navigating to the integration settings in Configuration -> Integrations and selecting the "Flux Led/Magic Home" configuration for the bulb or controller. 


**Custom Effect**\
A list of RGB colors can be entered to create an effect. The effect speed can be adjusted using the slider underneath.

**Custom Effect Type**\
This determines the transition between each color. 


### Effects

The Flux LED light offers a number of effects which are not included in other lighting packages. These can be selected from the front-end, or sent in the effect field of the `light.turn_on` command.
