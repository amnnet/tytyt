The Synology DSM sensor platform provides access to various statistics from your [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com) as well as cameras from the [Surveillance Station](https://www.synology.com/en-us/surveillance).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

<div class='note warning'>

This sensor will wake up your Synology NAS if it's in hibernation mode.

You can change the scan interval within the configuration options (default is 15 min).

Having cameras or the Home mode toggle from [Surveillance Station](https://www.synology.com/en-us/surveillance) will fetch every 30 seconds. Disable those entities if you don't want your NAS to be fetch as frequently.

## Separate User Configuration

Due to the nature of the Synology DSM API, it is required to grant the user admin rights. This is related to the fact that utilization information is stored in the core module.

When creating the user, it is possible to deny access to all locations and applications. By doing this, the user will not be able to login to the web interface or view any of the files on the Synology NAS. It is still able to read the utilization and storage information using the API.

### If you utilize 2-Step Verification or Two Factor Authentication (2FA) with your Synology NAS

If you have the "Enforce 2-step verification for the following users" option checked under **Control Panel > User > Advanced > 2-Step Verification**, you'll need to configure the 2-step verification/one-time password (OTP) for the user you just created before the credentials for this user will work with Home Assistant. 

Make sure to log out of your "normal" user's account and then login with the separate user you created specifically for Home Assistant. DSM will walk you through the process of setting up the one-time password for this user which you'll then be able to use in Home Assistant's frontend configuration screen. 

<div class='note'>
If you denied access to all locations and applications it is normal to receive a message indicating you do not have access to DSM when trying to login with this separate user. As noted above, you do not need access to the DSM and Home Assistant will still be able to read statistics from your NAS.

## Sensors

### CPU Utilisation sensors

Entities reporting the current and combined CPU utilization of the NAS. There are sensors the report the current CPU load, separated by User, System and others. By default, only the User sensor is enabled.

There are also combined CPU load sensors. These report the total CPU load for the entire NAS. Available as current, 1min, 5min and 15min load sensors. By default the 1min load sensor is disabled.

### Memory Utilisation sensors

Entities reporting the current and combined memory and swap utilization of the NAS. These sensors include the total installed amount, the currently free amount and the % of memory used. 

### Network sensors

Entities reporting the current network transfer rates of the NAS. Both upload and download sensors are available.

### General sensors

Entities reporting the internal temperature and the uptime of the NAS. The uptime sensor is disabled by default.

### Disk sensors

Entities reporting the internal temperature, status (as shown in Synology DSM) and SMART status for each drive inside the NAS. The SMART status sensor is disabled by default.

### Volume sensors

Entities reporting status, total size (TB), used size (TB), % of volume used, average disk temperature and maximum disk temperature for each volume inside the NAS. By default the total size and maximum disk temperature sensors are disabled.

## Binary sensors

### General sensors

Entities reporting the update and security status of the NAS.

<div class='note'>

The security status corresponds with the analysis of the DSM Security Advisor, e.g., an `outOfDate` state for the `Update` attribute not only reflects the update status of the installed DSM version but also the status of the installed DSM packages.

</div>

### Disk sensors

Similar to the [normal disk sensors](#disk-sensors), there are binary sensors reporting each drive's status. These sensors report if a drive has exceeded the maximum threshold for detected bad sectors and if a drive has dropped below the threshold for its remaining life.

## Switch

A switch is available to enable/disable the [Surveillance Station](https://www.synology.com/en-us/surveillance) Home mode.

## Cameras

For each camera added in [Surveillance Station](https://www.synology.com/en-us/surveillance), a camera will be created in Home Assistant.

## Services

### Service `synology_dsm.reboot`

Reboot the specified NAS by `serial`. If only one DSM is configured, `serial` is optional.

  | Service data attribute | Required | Description |
  | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `serial` | yes, when multiple NAS are configured | serial of DSM |

### Service `synology_dsm.shutdown`

Shutdown the specified NAS by `serial`. If only one DSM is configured, `serial` is optional.

  | Service data attribute | Required | Description |
  | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | `serial` | yes, when multiple NAS are configured | serial of DSM |
