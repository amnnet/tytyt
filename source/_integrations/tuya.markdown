The Tuya integration integrates all Powered by Tuya devices you have added to the Tuya Smart and Tuya Smart Life apps. Tuya officially maintains this integration.

All Home Assistant platforms are supported by the Tuya integration, except the lock and remote platform.

## Configuration of the Tuya IoT Platform

- You will also need to create an account in the [Tuya IoT Platform](https://iot.tuya.com/).
This is a separate account from the one you made for the app. You cannot log in with your app's credentials.

### Create a project

1. Log in to the [Tuya IoT Platform](https://iot.tuya.com/).
2. In the left navigation bar, click `Cloud` > `Development`. 
3. On the page that appears, click `Create Cloud Project`.
4. In the `Create Cloud Project` dialog box, configure `Project Name`, `Description`, `Industry`, and `Data Center`. For the `Development Method` field, select `Smart Home` from the dropdown list. For the `Data Center` field, select the zone you are located in.
