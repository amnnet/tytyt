The `picotts` text-to-speech platform uses [Pico TTS library](https://github.com/naggety/picotts) to read out text with natural sounding voices.
Pico TTS is a powerful open-source engine that runs locally (cloudless) so it can work even without an internet connection.

## Configuration

To enable text-to-speech with Pico, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
tts:
  - platform: picotts
```

{% configuration %}
language:
  description: "The language to use. Supported languages are `en-US`, `en-GB`, `de-DE`, `es-ES`, `fr-FR` and `it-IT`."
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "`en-US`"
{% endconfiguration %}

## Full configuration example

The configuration sample below shows how an entry can look like:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
tts:
  - platform: picotts
    language: "fr-FR"
```
