The `danfoss_air` integration allows you to access information from your Danfoss Air HRV unit.

*Note*: Danfoss Air CCM only accepts one TCP connection at a time. Due to this the integration will not work while you have the HRV PC-Tool open.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
danfoss_air:
  host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_CCM
```
