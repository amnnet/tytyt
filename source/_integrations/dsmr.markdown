A sensor platform for Belgian, Dutch, Luxembourg and Swedish Smart Meters which comply to DSMR (Dutch Smart Meter Requirements), also known as 'Slimme meter' or 'P1 poort'. Swedish meters with a 'HAN port' are not supported by this integration.

- Currently support DSMR V2.2, V3, V4, V5, Belgian V5 variant, Luxembourg V5 variant (Smarty) and the Swedish V5 variant through the [dsmr_parser](https://github.com/ndokter/dsmr_parser) module by Nigel Dokter.

### Configuration

- For Belgian meters, choose DSMR version `5B`
- For Dutch meters, choose DSMR version `2.2`, `4`, or `5`
- For Luxembourg meters, choose DSMR version `5L`
- For Swedish meters, choose DSMR version `5S`

### Options

To configure options for DSMR integration go to **Configuration** >> **Integrations** and press **Options** on the DSMR card.

#### Time between updates

Typically the smart meter sends new data every 5-10 seconds. This value defines the minimum time between entity updates in seconds. Setting this value to 0 will update entities each time data is received from the smart meter.

<div class='note warning'>
Reducing the default time between updates will increase the amount of events generated and can potentially flood the system with events.
</div>

### Supported meters

This integration is known to work for:

- Iskra ME382 / MT382 (DSMR 2.2)
- ISKRA AM550 (DSMR 5.0)
- Landis+Gyr E350 (DMSR 4)
- Landis+Gyr ZCF110 / ZM F110 (DSMR 4.2)
- Kaifa E0026
- Kamstrup 382JxC (DSMR 2.2)
- Sagemcom XS210 ESMR5
- Sagemcom T211 
- Ziv E0058 ESMR5

### Connecting to the meter

Connection can be done directly to the meter via a USB to serial connector, or through a serial to network proxy

#### USB serial converters:

- Cheap (Banggood/ebay) Generic PL2303
- [Smartmeter Webshop](https://sites.google.com/site/nta8130p1smartmeter/webshop)
- [SOS Solutions](https://www.sossolutions.nl/slimme-meter-kabel)
- [AliExpress](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/32945187155.html)

Docker users have to allow Docker access to the USB to serial converter by adding `--device /dev/ttyUSB21:/dev/ttyUSB21` to the run command:

```hass
$ docker run --device /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0 -d --name="home-assistant" -v /home/USERNAME/hass:/config -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro --net=host {{ site.installation.container.base }}
```

#### Serial to network proxies:

- [ser2net](http://ser2net.sourceforge.net)

Optional configuration example for ser2net 3.x.x:

```sh
# Example /etc/ser2net.conf for proxying USB/serial connections to DSMRv4 smart meters
2001:raw:600:/dev/ttyUSB0:115200 NONE 1STOPBIT 8DATABITS XONXOFF LOCAL -RTSCTS
```
or
```sh
# Example /etc/ser2net.conf for proxying USB/serial connections to DSMRv2.2 smart meters
2001:raw:600:/dev/ttyUSB0:9600 EVEN 1STOPBIT 7DATABITS XONXOFF LOCAL -RTSCTS
```

Optional configuration example for ser2net 4.x.x:

```sh
# Example /etc/ser2net.yaml for proxying USB/serial connections to DSMRv4 smart meters
connection: &con0096

### Technical overview

DSMR is a standard to which Dutch smartmeters must comply. It specifies that the smartmeter must send out a 'telegram' every 10 seconds (every second for DSMR 5.0 devices) over a serial port.

The contents of this telegram differ between version but they generally consist of lines with 'obis' (Object Identification System, a numerical ID for a value) followed with the value and unit.

Smart meters in Belgium, Luxembourg and Sweden provided telegrams with largely the same contents.

This module sets up an asynchronous reading loop using the `dsmr_parser` module which waits for a complete telegram, parser it and puts it on an async queue as a dictionary of `obis`/object mapping. The numeric value and unit of each value can be read from the objects attributes. Because the `obis` are know for each DSMR version the Entities for this integration are create during bootstrap.

Another loop (DSMR class) is setup which reads the telegram queue, stores/caches the latest telegram and notifies the Entities that the telegram has been updated.
