The Mazda Connected Services integration allows you to retrieve data from a Mazda vehicle. In order to use this integration, you must first register your vehicle using the MyMazda app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mymazda/id451886367)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.interrait.mymazda)).

This integration requires an active Mazda Connected Services subscription and a compatible vehicle. The following Mazda vehicles are Mazda Connected Services capable:

- Mazda3: 2019+
- CX-30: 2020+
- CX-9: 2021+
- CX-5: 2021+

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

<div class='note warning'>
    The MyMazda API only allows one active session at a time. Therefore, if you use the same account with both Home Assistant and the MyMazda mobile app, you may experience issues ("Multiple devices detected" notifications, session expired warnings, etc.) To fix this, you can create a secondary MyMazda account, and share your vehicle with the secondary account. Log in to the mobile app using the primary account and select Menu > MyMazda > My Vehicle > Drivers > Manage Drivers > Invite Driver. When finished, log into the secondary account with Home Assistant.

## Platforms

### Sensor

The following sensor entities are available:
- Fuel remaining
- Fuel distance remaining
- Odometer
- Tire pressure (not available for CX-5 and CX-9 models)

### Device tracker

Tracks the current location of the vehicle. This will generally update when the vehicle is switched off.

### Lock

Displays the current door lock status of the vehicle, and locks/unlocks the doors of the vehicle.

<div class='note info'>
    The "Automatic Re-Lock" feature will automatically re-lock the doors if they are not opened shortly after being unlocked. This applies regardless of whether you are using the key, or unlocking the doors remotely using Home Assistant or the MyMazda app.
