Home Assistant is a FAST moving open source project. This means occasionally the official documentation will not be 100% current or complete. Since this is an open source volunteer project, we would encourage anyone who finds gaps in the documentation to click the `EDIT` link at the bottom and submit any corrections/enhancements they may find useful. A step-by-step guide on how to contribute to the documentation can be found [here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/editing-the-documentation-and-creating-a-pull-request-on-github/9573).

In the absence of information, many users find it beneficial to look at other people's configurations to find examples of what they want to accomplish in their own configurations. The easiest way to find these configurations is through this [GitHub search](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahome-assistant-config&type=Repositories).
