A month ago, I wrote [a blog post][kickoff], starting our first month of
"What the heck?!" (WTH) ever! An experiment and without any expectations,
as we never had done anything like this before. But WTH, why not. 😁

And today, I think we can actually say: All good things come to an end.

It has been an amazing month! A whopping 746 topics have been created in the
[WTH forum][forum], that together collected over 4,500 posts. The contents of
all these created topics are amazing! And apparently, you all agreed on that,
as a stunning 2,600 likes have been given on all those posts.

About the content, it is amazing! There was some really good feedback in there.
Annoyances made many people think: “Yeah! What the heck?!” and more importantly,
developers chimed in as well!

Developers dived in and started resolving and fixing stuff! At the moment
of writing, a whopping 68 pull requests with code changes to address those WTHs
have been made. A lot of these are already shipped with the [0.115 birthday
release][release].

## So, what was fixed?

This list isn't even complete, but gives a nice idea of what went on. We think
it is an impressive accomplishment. If you are a bit into GitHub, you can find
[all pull requests made for the month of WTH][prs], as they are all labeled
with "WTH".

## Closing the WTH forum & Hacktoberfest

As said, all good things come to an end. We are going to close the WTH forum.
This means that no new WTH topics can be created, but everything will remain
visible.

Hacktoberfest is right around the corner and all current data in that forum
can really help drive it. It is a great resource for developers to find
opportunities to contribute on during the October month. So, while we close
it down, we hope more will be addressed.

Why not run this WTH all the time? Well, it looses its power over time. This is
already visible right now when comparing the velocity at the beginning and end
of the month.

However, let's see if we can do it again next year. Maybe, we should combine
it with Hacktoberfest in 2021?

How did you experience the month of WTH? Should we do it again?
