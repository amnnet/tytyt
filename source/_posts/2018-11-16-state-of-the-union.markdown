Last Wednesday, November 14, we had a meetup in Amsterdam hosted by <a href='https://www.ing.nl'>ING</a>. Over 80 Home Assistant enthusiasts gathered to hear me, Paulus Schoutsen, the founder of Home Assistant, speak. I talked about how Home Assistant got started, what makes Home Assistant so successful (community!) and what we're working towards.
