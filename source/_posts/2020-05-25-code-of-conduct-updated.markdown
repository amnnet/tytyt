On January 21st, 2017, Home Assistant [announced](/blog/2017/01/21/home-assistant-governance/)
we had implemented a Code of Conduct. Using this blog post, we'd like to
inform you we are updating our Code of Conduct.

## Why a Code of Conduct?

Our ever-growing community, consists of people from all over the world,
and we want to ensure our community is a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity,
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

The Code of Conduct describes what type of behavior is considered unacceptable
in our community, how we will enforce violations of it and how one can report
incidents.

This keeps our community open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive and healthy.

## What has been updated?

Our code of conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/),
which has been implemented by over 200,000 open source projects around the world.
They have been updating it to version 2.0, and Home Assistant will now follow
up on that.

In general, not much has [changed compared to what we already had](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/pull/13588/files).
Mainly wording has been improved. The main change would be the addition of
enforcement guidelines. This helps the Home Assistant members, contributors,
moderators, admins and maintainers in how to apply enforcements.

Moving forward, this updated Code of Conduct will be active for all projects,
social channels and community communication channels of the Home Assistant
organization.
