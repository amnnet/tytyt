Today we are launching our brand new [data science portal][post] to teach you how you can learn from your own smart home data. Learn what data Home Assistant stores locally and learn to explore your data. In 15 minutes, you will set up a local data science environment and are running reports on your own data.

We have worked hard on a smooth experience. Single click to set up a local data science environment powered by Jupyter. Pre-installed with our Getting Started notebook for Home Assistant, automatically connects to your database and generates reports with a single click.

All of this is powered by the new JupyterLab hass.io add-on by [@frenck] and the new HASS Data Detective Python package by [@robmarkcole].

Today is only the start. We will continue to develop the data tools for Home Assistant. Itâ€™s our goal to make Home Assistant the easiest platform to use for data scientists interested in home automation.
