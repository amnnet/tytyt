## Install Home Assistant Supervised

<div class='note warning'>

This way of running Home Assistant will require the most of you. It also has strict requirements you need to follow.

Unless you really need this installation type, you should install Home Assistant OS (this can also be a [virtual machine](#install-home-assistant-operating-system)), or [Home Assistant Container](#install-home-assistant-container).

1. First make sure you understand the <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/blob/master/adr/0014-home-assistant-supervised.md" target="_blank">requirements</a>.
2. Then head over to <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer" target="_blank">home-assistant/supervised-installer</a> to set it up.

Once the Home Assistant Supervised installation is running and Home Assistant accessible you can continue with onboarding.
