## The issue

Running the Supervisor in an LXC virtual machine will cause issues both with
performance and with container management in general. Using LXC in combination
with the Supervisor is not supported.

## The solution

You need to reinstall the host operating system that runs the Supervisor,
for instructions on how to prosed with that [have a look here](/more-info/unsupported/os).
