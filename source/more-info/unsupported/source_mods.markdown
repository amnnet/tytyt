## The issue

We can't support source modifications that are untested and not approved by the Home Assistant project.
Of course, it is no problem, you are allowed to run your installation with modification of your own; however, it will cause the loss of the official supported state of the installation.

## The solution

Revert your source modification and restart the system or reinstall everything new.
