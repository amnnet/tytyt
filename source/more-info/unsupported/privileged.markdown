## The issue

The Supervisor needs to have privileged access to the docker runtime on your host
to be able to do everything it needs to do.

## The solution

If you are running an older version of our Home Assistant OS, update it in the
supervisor panel.

If this is not our Home Assistant OS, you need to re-run our
[convenience installation script](https://github.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer).
