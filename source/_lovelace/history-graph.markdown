To add the History Graph card to your user interface, click the Lovelace menu (three dots at the top right of the screen) and then **Edit Dashboard**. Click the "Add Card" button in the bottom right corner and select **History Graph** from the card picker. All options for this card can be configured via the user interface.

{% configuration %}
type:
  required: true
  description: history-graph
  type: string
entities:
  required: true
  description: "A list of entity IDs or `entity` objects, see below."
  type: list
hours_to_show:
  required: false
  description: Hours to show in graph. Minimum is 1 hour. Big values can result in delayed rendering, especially if the selected entities have a lot of state changes.
  type: integer
  default: 24
refresh_interval:
  required: false
  description: Refresh interval in seconds.
  type: integer
  default: 0
title:
  required: false
  description: The card title.
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Options For Entities

If you define entities as objects instead of strings, you can add more customization and configuration:

{% configuration %}
entity:
  required: true
  description: Entity ID.
  type: string
name:
  required: false
  description: Overwrites friendly name.
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Examples

Alternatively, the card can be configured using YAML:

```yaml
type: history-graph
title: 'My Graph'
entities:
  - sensor.outside_temperature
  - entity: media_player.lounge_room
    name: Main player
```

Or with longer time frame, and multiple entities (as long as they share the same unit_of_measurement) in one graph:

```yaml
type: history-graph
title: "Temperatures in the last 48 hours"
hours_to_show: 48
entities:
  - sensor.outside_temperature
  - entity: sensor.lounge_temperature
    name: "Lounge"
  - entity: sensor.attic_temperature
    name: "Attic"
```
