The Picture Entity card displays an entity in the form of an image. Instead of images from URL, it can also show the picture of `camera` entities.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/lovelace/lovelace_picture_entity.gif' alt='Picture entity card'>
  Background changes according to the entity state.
</p>

## How to use state_filter

Specify different [CSS filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter)

```yaml
state_filter:
  "on": brightness(110%) saturate(1.2)
  "off": brightness(50%) hue-rotate(45deg)
```

## Examples

Basic example:

```yaml
type: picture-entity
entity: light.bed_light
image: /local/bed_light.png
```

Different images for each state:

```yaml
type: picture-entity
entity: light.bed_light
state_image:
  "on": /local/bed_light_on.png
  "off": /local/bed_light_off.png
```

Displaying a live feed from an FFmpeg camera:

{% raw %}

```yaml
type: picture-entity
entity: camera.backdoor
camera_view: live
tap_action:
  action: call-service
  service: camera.snapshot
  service_data:
    entity_id: camera.backdoor
    filename: '/shared/backdoor-{{ now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S") }}.jpg'
```

{% endraw %}

The filename needs to be a path that is writable by Home Assistant in your system. You may need to configure `allowlist_external_dirs` ([documentation](/docs/configuration/basic/)).
