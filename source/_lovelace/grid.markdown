The Grid card allows you to show multiple cards in a grid. It will first fill the columns, automatically adding new rows as needed.

## Examples

Alternatively, the card can be configured using YAML:

Basic example:

```yaml
type: grid
cards:
  - type: picture-entity
    entity: camera.demo_camera
    show_info: false
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - binary_sensor.movement_backyard
```

Defining columns and disabling the square option:

```yaml
type: grid
title: Backyard
columns: 2
square: false
cards:
  - type: picture-entity
    entity: group.all_lights
    image:  /local/house.png
  - type: horizontal-stack
    cards:
      - type: picture-entity
        entity: light.ceiling_lights
        image: /local/bed_1.png
      - type: picture-entity
        entity: light.bed_light
        image: /local/bed_2.png
```
