The Webpage card allows you to embed your favorite webpage right into Home Assistant. You can also embed files stored in your `<config-directory>/www` folder and reference them using `/local/<file>`.

<div class='note warning'>
You can't embed sites using HTTP if you are using HTTPS for your Home Assistant.
</div>
