The Vertical Stack card allows you to group multiple cards so they always sit in the same column.

To add the Vertical Stack card to your user interface, click the Lovelace menu (three dots at the top right of the screen) and then **Edit Dashboard**. Click the "Add Card" button in the bottom right corner and select **Vertical Stack** from the card picker. All options for this card can be configured via the user interface.

{% configuration %}
type:
  required: true
  description: "`vertical-stack`"
  type: string
title:
  required: false
  description: Title of stack.
  type: string
cards:
  required: true
  description: List of cards.
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

## Examples

Alternatively, the card can be configured using YAML:

Basic example:

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
title: Backyard
cards:
  - type: picture-entity
    entity: camera.demo_camera
    show_info: false
  - type: entities
    entities:
      - binary_sensor.movement_backyard
```
