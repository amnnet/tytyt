## How to use state_filter

Specify different [CSS filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter)

```yaml
state_filter:
  "on": brightness(110%) saturate(1.2)
  "off": brightness(50%) hue-rotate(45deg)
entity: switch.decorative_lights
```

## Examples

```yaml
type: picture-glance
title: Living room
entities:
  - switch.decorative_lights
  - light.ceiling_lights
  - lock.front_door
  - binary_sensor.movement_backyard
  - binary_sensor.basement_floor_wet
image: /local/living_room.png
```

Display a camera image as background:

```yaml
type: picture-glance
title: Living room
entities:
  - switch.decorative_lights
  - light.ceiling_lights
camera_image: camera.demo_camera
```

Display a camera image without additional entities:

```yaml
type: picture-glance
title: Front garden
entities: []
camera_image: camera.front_garden_camera
```

Use different images based on entity state:

```yaml
type: picture-glance
title: Living room
entities:
  - switch.decorative_lights
  - light.ceiling_lights
state_image:
  "on": /local/living_room_on.png
  "off": /local/living_room_off.png
entity: group.living.room
```
