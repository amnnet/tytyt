As part of the default onboarding process, Home Assistant can detect your location from IP address geolocation. Home Assistant will automatically select a temperature unit and time zone based on this location. You may adjust this during onboarding, or afterwards at {% my general title="Configuration -> General" %}.

If you prefer YAML, you can add the following information to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  name: Home
  latitude: 32.87336
  longitude: 117.22743
  elevation: 430
  unit_system: metric
  currency: USD
  time_zone: "America/Los_Angeles"
  external_url: "https://www.example.com"
  internal_url: "http://homeassistant.local:8123"
  allowlist_external_dirs:
    - "/usr/var/dumping-ground"
    - "/tmp"
  allowlist_external_urls:
    - "http://images.com/image1.png"
  media_dirs:
    media: "/media"
    recordings: "/mnt/recordings"
  legacy_templates: false
```

NOTE: You will not be able to edit anything in {% my general title="Configuration -> General" %} in the UI if you are using YAML configuration for any of the following: name, latitude, longitude, elevation, unit_system, temperature_unit, time_zone, external_url, internal_url.

## Reload Core Service

Home Assistant offers a service to reload the core configuration while Home Assistant is running called {% my developer_call_service service="homeassistant.reload_core_config" %}. This allows you to change any of the above sections and see it being applied without having to restart Home Assistant. To call this service, go to the "{% my developer_services %}" tab under {% my developer_services title="Developer Tools" %}, select the {% my developer_call_service service="homeassistant.reload_core_config" %} service and click the "CALL SERVICE" button. Alternatively, you can press the "Reload Location & Customizations" button under {% my server_controls title="Configuration > Server Control" %}.
