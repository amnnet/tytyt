MQTT (aka MQ Telemetry Transport) is a machine-to-machine or "Internet of Things" connectivity protocol on top of TCP/IP. It allows extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

To integrate MQTT into Home Assistant, you need to setup the [MQTT integration](/integrations/mqtt).

You will also need to setup an MQTT broker, please refer to the [MQTT broker](/docs/mqtt/broker) documentation.
