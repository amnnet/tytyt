The automation editor is an easy way of creating and editing automations from the UI. This page uses the [Random sensor](/integrations/random#sensor) as an example, though any other sensor with a numeric value, can be used as well.

From the UI choose **{% my config %}** which is located in the sidebar, then click on **{% my automations %}** to go to the automation editor. Press the **+** sign in the lower right corner to get started. You will be presented with options to create the automation from a description or from a [blueprint](/docs/automation/using_blueprints/).

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/docs/automation-editor/create-automation.png' />
</p>

Select "Start with an empty automation" and choose a meaningful name for your new automation.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/docs/automation-editor/new-automation.png' />
</p>

If the value of the sensor is greater than 10, then the automation should trigger.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/docs/automation-editor/new-trigger.png' />
</p>

The action for this automation creates a [persistent notification](/integrations/persistent_notification/).

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/docs/automation-editor/new-action.png' />
</p>

As the message we want a simple text that is shown as part of the notification.

```yaml
message: Sensor value greater than 10
```

Automations created or edited via the user interface are activated immediately after saving the automation. Read the documentation for [Automating Home Assistant](/getting-started/automation/) to learn more about automations.

## Troubleshooting missing automations

When you're creating automations using the GUI and they don't appear in the UI, make sure that you add back `automation: !include automations.yaml` from the default configuration to your `configuration.yaml`.
