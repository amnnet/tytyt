Home Assistant can integrate the energy usage of individual devices into Home Assistant. That way you can see the impact of individual devices on your total energy consumption.

## Hardware

### Smart plugs

Smart plugs sit between the device and the outlet and measure the energy flowing through the device.

Depending on what protocols you use at home, you can use Zigbee, Z-Wave or Wi-Fi based plugs.

### Smart Relays

Smart relays sit behind your "normal" switches and make them smart. It allows you to control the devices via Home Assistant and via the connected buttons/switches.

We recommend the Shelly brand because they have a local API that updates Home Assistant as soon as something happens and it has a high quality integration:
